# noodle — agent guide

A **node-based parametric CAD app** built on [build123d](https://build123d.readthedocs.io).
You wire nodes in a web editor; the backend **transpiles the graph to build123d
Python**, runs it in an isolated worker, and returns an STL + a mesh "view" for
the 3D viewport. It ships with an **in-app AI copilot** (natural language → graph)
and an **MCP server** exposing the same operations.

This file is the orientation doc for an AI agent picking up the project. It
covers what it is, how to run it, how it's laid out, and how to change it safely.

> **Using noodle rather than changing it** — building or editing a model for
> the user? You want the MCP tools (or their HTTP twins) and the guide they
> serve: `cad_help` / `GET /api/agent/help`, source `cad_nodes/AGENT_HELP.md`,
> with detail topics (`screenshots`, `retroeng`, `print`, `threads`, `fluid`).
> Never hand-edit a project's graph.json — see §6e for why the API exists.

---

## 1. Run it

The app is containerized (`noodle` service). The image is **build123d-only**
on purpose — cadquery 2.7.0 pins an OCP/OCCT build that conflicts with build123d
(see `PLAN_NODE_CAD.md` and the memory note "build123d/cadquery OCP conflict").

```bash
docker compose up -d --build      # build + start
docker restart noodle         # after backend code changes (see §6)
docker logs -f noodle         # tail logs
```

**Rootless podman** (quill's NixOS box — `docker` IS podman there): use
`noodle-compose up -d` (on PATH via the project devShell) instead of plain
compose for anything that CREATES the container. It is podman-compose plus
`--userns=keep-id:uid=1000,gid=1000`, without which the container's uid 1000
lands in a subuid and the server cannot write the bind-mounted `projects/`
(measured: every /execute 500s with PermissionError; `PODMAN_USERNS` is not
enough — podman reads it, podman-compose does not pass it through).
`docker restart` / `docker logs` work as-is. The compose file itself stays
docker-pure; don't add podman-specific keys to it.

- Node editor: <http://localhost:8090/nodes>   ·   code view: `/ui` (read-only
  build123d generated from the graph)   ·   health: `/health`
- The container runs as the non-root user **noodle (uid 1000)**, Python 3.10,
  serving `uvicorn server:app` on 8090.
- Volumes (see `docker-compose.yml`): `./projects` is read-write; `cad_nodes/`,
  `webui/`, `server.py`, `mcp_server.py` are mounted **read-only**, so
  host edits are visible to the container but the running process must be
  restarted to re-import them.

**Copilot LLM backend** (env in `docker-compose.yml`): defaults to a free local
**Ollama** at `host.docker.internal:11434` (`COPILOT_MODEL`, e.g. `qwen2.5`).
For a keyed OpenAI-compatible provider instead, set `COPILOT_BASE_URL` +
`COPILOT_API_KEY` + `COPILOT_MODEL` (Groq / OpenRouter / Gemini's OpenAI endpoint…).

## 2. Develop & verify outside the editor

Run the engine where it will really run — **in the container**. This needs no
host setup and cannot drift from production:

```bash
docker exec -i noodle python - <<'PY' 2>/dev/null   # hides fontconfig noise
import json, pathlib
from cad_nodes.graph import Graph
from cad_nodes.transpiler import transpile
from cad_nodes.executor import execute_graph
g = Graph.from_dict(json.loads(pathlib.Path("/app/projects/<name>/graph.json").read_text()))
print(transpile(g))                                   # inspect generated build123d source
view = execute_graph(g, pathlib.Path("/tmp/work"), timeout=60).get("view")
print(view["success"], view.get("node_errors"))       # per-node errors if any
PY
```

To exercise a **PREAMBLE helper** on its own — no graph, no worker — take it
straight out of the transpiler and call it:

```bash
docker exec -i noodle python -c "
from cad_nodes.transpiler import PREAMBLE
G = {}; exec(PREAMBLE, G)
print(G['_bbox_plane'])          # any helper, callable, with build123d loaded"
```

When the part you want to check is pure arithmetic, lift that fragment out and
test it with no build123d in the room at all — `tests/test_polyhedron.py::
_preamble_fragment` and `tests/test_thread.py::_fragment` both do this.

A host venv also works and iterates faster, but it is **optional and frequently
absent — never assume it exists**; create it with
`python -m venv .venv-b123d && .venv-b123d/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Then drive the live server: `curl -s -X POST localhost:8090/api/graph/<name>/execute`
— and **look at the result**: `GET /api/graph/<name>/screenshot` (§9). Numbers
verify what you thought to measure; a picture shows what you did not.

## 3. Architecture & file map

```
server.py            FastAPI HTTP API (port 8090). Routes under /api/* :

                       a graph body = stateless and returns it, without = load/
                       arrange/save — §6c),

                       /api/aliases (GET the personal add-node search aliases)
                       + PUT /api/aliases/{node_type} (replace one node's, []
                       clears) — stored in projects/_aliases.json, see §6,
                       /api/agent/help[?topic=] (self-contained remote-agent
                       guide = cad_nodes/AGENT_HELP.md, also MCP cad_help/
                       cad://help; the `## topic:` sections after its marker
                       are served only on request — keep it in sync when the
                       API surface changes; a test fails if it names a cad_*
                       tool that does not exist),
                       the agent editing surface (§6e): GET /api/graph/{name}/
                       compact|validate, POST .../ops|set_param|edit_code,
                       POST .../execute?lean=1 (+ body {overrides}), GET
                       /api/nodes?query=|compact=1 and /api/nodes/{type},
                       /api/agent/tags (ToAgent provenance index, §7b),
                       /api/graph/{name}/slice_summary|section_outline (§7b),
                       /api/graph/{name}/gens/{gen}/measures[/exact] (↔ Metro, §9c),
                       /api/graph/{name}/screenshot (PNG of the viewport, §9 —
                       the agent's eyes; also MCP cad_screenshot),
                       POST /api/graph/{name}/anticipate (baked meshes of the
                       operands a drag cannot change — §6b, anticipate.js),
                       /api/graph/{name}/progress?run=<id> (SSE: per-node execution
                       events, tailed from projects/<name>/.runs/<hash>/progress.jsonl
                       — see transpiler `_ev` and cad_nodes/job_files.py. `run` is the
                       id the caller is about to POST to /execute?run=; each run owns
                       its own script/view/progress so two concurrent jobs cannot
                       overwrite each other. A root progress.jsonl is only an atomic
                       "latest run" pointer. The run closes with a `done` line so the
                       stream hangs up. POST /runs/{run}/cancel writes a cancel file.
                       Omit `run` and you get the next run that starts — MCP/curl),
                       POST /api/graph/{name}/execute may take a graph snapshot body
                       (the editor does; MCP/curl with no body run the file on disk),
                       /api/system/health|logs|restart.
                       NOTE every route that reaches the executor goes through
                       `off_loop()` — execute, render, download, export,
                       slice_summary, section_outline, subshapes. An engine call
                       is seconds of blocking CPU and must NOT hold the event
                       loop, or nothing else is served meanwhile (the progress
                       stream reporting on that very run included). Six of the
                       seven used to call it straight from `async def`; measured
                       on threaded-jar-pour, /health took **3.39s** during a 3.8s
                       render and **1.2ms** after. `subshapes` was the worst,
                       since the selection picker calls it on every click.
                       `off_loop` is one named helper rather than scattered
                       `to_thread` calls so the rule stays greppable and its
                       reasoning lives in one docstring; tests/test_off_loop.py
                       pins it structurally (a wrapped call passes the engine
                       function by NAME, so it is never a Call target — any
                       ast.Call on an engine name is a regression). /screenshot
                       is the deliberate exception: its work is in the browser
                       process, so it only awaits I/O.
mcp_server.py        MCP server exposing the same cad_nodes.api operations.
webui/
  viewer.js          ★ the SHARED Three.js viewport (ES module served at
                       /static/viewer.js), imported by BOTH pages. `CadViewer`
                       owns the Z-up CAD scene (grid/lights/ViewHelper), the
                       animate loop, framing/resize, `loadSTL`, and the live
                       multi-mesh `renderPreviews(previews, {colorOf,wireOf,
                       onEmpty})` from a view.json. Page-specific behaviour stays
                       in the pages and hooks onto the exposed scene/camera/
                       previewGroup (nodes.html: the gizmo + click-to-select via
                       viewer.pick()). Both pages now render identically.
                       RENDERING (`makeMaterial`, HQ toggle in Settings): filmic
                       tone mapping + a RoomEnvironment IBL, and a per-node
                       `finish` — solid / glass (real `transmission`, not alpha) /
                       emissive / metal — plus `rainbow` (a hue per piece via the
                       golden angle, as geometry groups sharing one buffer).
                       SELECTIVE BLOOM, and it has to be selective: `transmission`
                       is not blending — three renders the scene to its own target
                       and samples it refracted, so an emitter seen THROUGH glass
                       arrives attenuated, falls under any luminance threshold, and
                       a bloom on the finished image stops dead at the glass. So
                       emitters get `GLOW_LAYER` (markGlow), render ALONE on black
                       (background nulled, or the clear colour blooms too), blur at
                       half res with threshold 0, and are composited ADDITIVELY on
                       top — which is what makes the glow cross the glass and
                       spread. `snapshot()` reads the canvas back as a JPEG data
                       URL for the workflow thumbnail (§9b) — same render path,
                       one extra frame, camera restored in a `finally`.
                       Two things that bit: the glow target holds LINEAR
                       un-tone-mapped values (three tone maps only to the canvas)
                       and UnrealBloomPass returns emitters+blur, so the quad is
                       scaled down or the core blows white twice over; and
                       `emissiveIntensity` must stay BELOW 1 — past it ACES
                       desaturates the highlight and the glowing body goes flat
                       white. No refraction of the glow and no caustics: those need
                       rays. Costs ~0-1fps (glass dominates); off unless HQ and
                       something declares itself emissive.
  anticipate.js      boolean drag anticipation (§6b): plan the dirty chain from a
                       dragged node to the screen, redo it on meshes with the
                       vendored manifold-wasm. Pure module (no three, no DOM).
  view.html          the `/view/<graph>/<gen>` read-only viewer of a frozen
                       GENERATION (§9c): hide / solo / invert pieces, state in
                       the URL hash. What an agent links instead of screenshots.
  index.html         the `/ui` code view — generated build123d source (read-only
                       text) + STL preview. Parameter literals are highlighted
                       and click-to-edit via a terminal-style inline editor that
                       PATCHes the graph param and re-renders — non-destructive
                       (the code is regenerated; structure stays in nodes.html).
                       See PLAN_CODE_PARAMS.md.
  nodes.html         the node editor + 3D viewer (litegraph-style). Holds
                       WIRE_COLORS; INPUT_ACCEPTS is fetched at boot from
                       /api/wiretypes (derived from casts.py, §5 — the inline
                       literal is only an offline fallback).
                       Execution glow (beginExecGlow/glowEvent/drawExecGlow): the nodes
                       light up AS THEY RUN. Each event opens or closes a node's span.
                       A node executing right now breathes amber; when it finishes it
                       settles and fades — green if it really recomputed, cold blue if
                       the memo cache served it, red if it threw.
                       RUNS ARE IDENTIFIED, NOT INFERRED — three bugs were paid for here
                       and every one of them read as "the glow stops at random":
                       (1) runGraph mints a `run` id and passes it to BOTH
                       /progress?run= and /execute?run=. Each run now has its own files
                       under `.runs/`; the root progress.jsonl is only a latest-run
                       pointer. The old tailer watched ONE shared file's SIZE and, when
                       a run rewrote it to the same length inside one 50ms poll, dropped
                       the whole run (measured: 5/5 nodes on voronoi-3d-lattice). (2) The stream is NOT closed
                       when the POST resolves: the browser dispatches that GET up to
                       ~90ms AFTER the POST and needs ~90ms more to connect, so a warm
                       ~350ms run was over before its stream arrived — only run 1 glowed
                       and runs 2-5 received nothing at all. The run marks its own end
                       instead (executor writes a `done` line in a `finally`; the server
                       hangs up on it, freeing the connection — Request.is_disconnected()
                       NEVER fires inside a StreamingResponse, measured, so a stream with
                       no defined end lingers the full 180s idle timeout holding one of
                       Chrome's 6 per-host connections). PROGRESS_GRACE_MS is only the
                       backstop. (3) beginExecGlow stamps each glow with an id and
                       endExecGlow(id) refuses to close one that isn't its own — a
                       superseded run rejects on a microtask, i.e. AFTER its successor
                       installed its glow, so it used to tear down the run that mattered
                       (in Live mode a run is superseded on every 120ms debounce tick).
                       Regression tests: tests/perf/test_progress_truth.py (backend) and
                       test_ui_reactivity.py::test_every_run_glows_in_the_editor — the
                       backend ones ALL passed while (2) was broken, so the browser-level
                       one is the load-bearing one.
                       Cost badges (drawCostBadge, toolbar "Costi" toggle, remembered
                       in localStorage `noodle:settings:showCost`): the same story made
                       to stay — last run's wall-clock on each node's title bar, same
                       colour vocabulary (blue "cache" = the memo store served it and it
                       cost nothing, amber→green = a real recompute with the hue set by
                       cost, red = it threw). The editor doubles as a profiler.
                       parseCbParams() mirrors transpiler.parse_codeblock_params:
                       a CodeBlock's `#@param`s become live widgets + dynamic
                       input sockets (overrides in the `_cb` param namespace),
                       editable via the ✎ Edit code modal. A BroadcastChannel
                       ('noodle:link') cross-links the two views: clicking a
                       value in /ui selects+flashes the node here; selecting a
                       node here scrolls /ui to it (nodeByGraphId tracks on-disk
                       ids). The /ui code view also scrubs numbers by drag,
                       Tab-cycles spans, and Ctrl+Z-undoes param edits.

                       nested `with` blocks. PREAMBLE injects runtime helpers
                       (_at, _pushpull, _section, _bbox_plane, _rotate,
                       _select_subshapes, _reanchor). Each node is wrapped in
                       try/except so one failing node is recorded in __errors__,
                       not fatal.
                       TRAP, paid for: build123d's algebra-mode fillet()/chamfer()
                       take NO target — they read `objects[0].topo_parent`, which
                       after a boolean still names the PRE-boolean operand. Round a
                       corner of a Union and you silently get that operand back,
                       the rest of the part deleted and no error raised. So every
                       rounding node passes its `part` EXPLICITLY and _reanchor()
                       re-points the picks at it (in place — chamfer()'s 2D branch
                       matches picks by TShape identity, so copies match nothing).
                       Never call bare fillet()/chamfer() in a code_template.
                       run(emit_map=True) / transpile_with_map() also return a
                       param<->code source map (sentinel-wrapped literals measured
                       on the final text) for the editable code view. A CodeBlock
                       transpiles like two connected nodes: `#@param` decls
                       (parse_codeblock_params) become the generated function's
                       named ARGUMENTS — body stays pure (declaration lines dropped),
                       each value appears once at the call site as an editable span
                       (override in node.params["_cb"], wired socket drives + fans
                       out). The body itself is an editable `code` span (kind=code).
                       transpile(memo=True) — the execute path ONLY, /ui code stays
                       clean — wraps each cacheable node in _memo_get/_memo_put
                       keyed by a content hash (params+code+upstream keys, immune
                       to var renumbering); non-deterministic nodes (Import*,
                       open(), random.) poison their lineage, display/export
                       side-effect nodes stay keyed but re-run. tests/test_memo.py.
                       In memo mode each node also brackets itself in `_ev()`
                       (PREAMBLE): a start/end NDJSON line appended+flushed to
                       __PROGRESS_PATH__ = the workdir's progress.jsonl (injected by
                       executor.build_script). That file is the ONLY progress channel
                       that works on BOTH paths — the warm worker redirects stdout
                       into a buffer during exec, and the cold subprocess has no pipe
                       home at all. The editor tails it over SSE and lights each node
                       AS IT RUNS. It is shared and rewritten in place, so a run BRACKETS
                       itself in it: executor writes a `{"k":"run","r":<id>}` header when
                       it opens the file and a `{"k":"done"}` line in a `finally` when it
                       is over. Both are load-bearing — see the glow notes under
                       webui/nodes.html for the three ways this went wrong without them.
  executor.py        Runs the generated script in a worker subprocess; captures
                       STL + view JSON + per-node errors. execute_graph(graph, workdir,
                       run_id=…) — run_id names the run inside progress.jsonl.
                       WarmWorker._lock serialises runs, and a run holds it for its
                       whole duration — so ANYTHING taking that lock from the event
                       loop freezes the server just as a CPU call would. shutdown()
                       does (set_warm(False) → POST /api/system/warm), which is why
                       that route goes through off_loop(): clicking the ⚙ toggle
                       mid-run used to hang everything (/health 601ms → 1.0ms). The
                       WAIT itself is correct and stays — killing the worker under a
                       running job would be worse — and it is bounded, since a run
                       cannot outlive its own timeout. warm_status() only reads
                       _alive(), takes no lock, so the GET is free.
                       MEASURED AND NOT A BUG, so nobody "fixes" it again: run() was
                       suspected of wedging on stdin.write under the lock. It does
                       not. Driven against a worker that is silent / deaf / flooding
                       stdout and never reads stdin, run() returned {'timeout':True}
                       at exactly its timeout in all three cases and released the
                       lock every time; five timeout+kill cycles leaked no threads,
                       no fds and no zombies. The bound is _read_sentinel's
                       join(timeout), and it holds.

## 4. Data model

A project is `projects/<name>/graph.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "demo",
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "n1", "type": "Sphere", "params": {"radius": 3},
      "position": [120,80], "preview": true }      // preview: per-node eye override
  ],
  "connections": [
    { "id": "l1", "from_node": "n1", "from_socket": "result",
      "to_node": "n2", "to_socket": "shape" }
  ],
  "groups": [                                        // optional, editor-only
    { "title": "Base body", "bounding": [20,40,300,760], "color": "#3f589e" }
  ]
}
```

`groups` are LiteGraph group boxes that visually cluster nodes (title + bounding
rect + colour). They're **editor-only metadata**: the engine never reads them, but
`Graph` carries them through `to_dict`/`from_dict` so logical grouping survives
save/reload and api/copilot round-trips. Serialized/restored in `nodes.html`
(`toGraphJSON`/`fromGraphJSON`); created with Ctrl+G (`groupSelected`).

`preview` is the per-node eye: `True`/`False` force it, absent = auto (draw only
terminal geometry nodes). **Every emit path must call `Transpiler._previewed`** —
it is the ONE gate, and an emit path that forgets it leaves the eye wired to
nothing, silently, for every node of that type (that was feedback
20260718-164854: selectors, CenterOfMass, TraceImage, OrientForPrint and
bypassed nodes all had dead toggles). Selectors are the special case: their
output wire is `selection`/`data`, which says how they may be WIRED, not what
they hold — at run time it is drawable sub-shapes, so they honour an EXPLICIT
eye but never auto-draw (a graph is full of wired selectors; drawing them all
unasked buries the part). `mesh_extractor._preview_geom` then dispatches on the
runtime VALUE, not the declared type: points → dots, solid/sketch → mesh, curve
→ polylines.

`params._ui` is another editor-only namespace (like CodeBlock's `_cb`): per-slider
drag window + step set via the slider's ⚙ (`{param: {min,max,step}}`). Sliders in
the editor are a custom `cadslider` widget — the drag window defaults to ±10
(clipped to catalog hard bounds, auto-grown to contain the value) and drag snaps
to the step; the typed ✎ field clamps only on the catalog's hard min/max. The
drag is RELATIVE (a press never changes the value; moving shifts it by the
distance, track = the whole window) and the window only grows during a session
(`w._win`) and is frozen for the gesture — derived from the value alone it used to
collapse back to −10…10 as soon as a 120 went under 10, and a press on the left of
an absolute slider was what took it there. The
engine resolves params by catalog name, so it never sees `_ui`.

**PLAY** — a ▶ hotspot left of the ⚙ sweeps the param across its drag window on a
clock; speed (sweeps/second) and mode (`once` / `loop` / `pingpong`) live in the
same namespace, `_ui[param].play`. It drives the value through `w.callback`, i.e.
through the exact path a hand on the slider uses, so undo, the ✎ field and the
gizmo snapshots all behave as if it were being dragged — and that is also why it
composes with Live at no cost: `scheduleLive()`'s 120ms debounce is reset every
frame and never fires, so an anticipatable node (§6b) replays locally at 60fps
and exactly ONE exact re-bake lands when play stops (measured: 0 runs during a
sweep, 1 after). A node no fast path can anticipate would then show nothing until
stop, so play instead **pumps** the engine — one run at a time, the next starting
only when the last has landed, because `runGraph()` aborts whatever is in flight
and overlapping calls would starve every run but the last (measured: ~1.1 runs/s,
0 overlapping). The playing state is deliberately transient: never saved, and
loading a graph or deleting a node stops it.

Execution writes `output.stl` + `view.json` (meshes) alongside it.

## 5. Wire types

Typed wires gate which output may feed which input. The single source of truth
is **`cad_nodes/casts.py`** (see PLAN_DATA_PROTOCOL.md): a small cast registry
`CASTS[(src, dst)] -> coercion helper` from which both tables are **derived** —
`WIRE_COMPATIBLE` (backend, enforced hard by `Graph.validate()`) and
`INPUT_ACCEPTS` (frontend, fetched at boot from `/api/wiretypes`; the literal in
`nodes.html` is only a fallback for when the endpoint is absent). They can no
longer drift — to change compatibility, edit `casts.py` only.

Types (constants in `casts.py`): `solid` (3D B-Rep — the old `geometry`),
`surface` (2D sketch/face — the old `sketch`), `curve`, `plane`, `vector`
(points), `selection` (picked sub-shapes), `mesh` (triangles — §5c), `data`,
`tree` (declared, unused).
`data` is the universal bus (any output → a `data` input; a `data` output feeds
everything except `selection`/`tree`). Registered casts: `surface→solid`,
`solid↔plane` (transforms treat a plane like geometry), `curve→surface`
(closed curve → face via `_face`), `selection→vector`, `solid/surface→mesh`
(`_to_mesh`). A `Socket` can also widen per-socket via `accepts=[…]`, carry an
advisory `subtype` (legend only, not validation), or set `raw=True` to opt out of
automatic boundary casts. The transpiler applies a registered cast automatically
at the wire boundary (`Transpiler._cast`).

## 5c. The mesh lane (triangles)

**build123d cannot model meshes** — it treats them as an I/O format. `import_stl`
returns a `Face` with only a triangulation and no surface (`is_valid=False`,
`volume=0`, booleans refused outright); `Mesher.read` sews every triangle into a
planar B-Rep face — **300s** to open a 147k-triangle STL, **81s** per boolean. And
OCCT has no remesh/decimate/mesh-repair at all. So triangles get their own lane,
on **trimesh** (MIT — noodle stays MIT; pymeshlab is GPL-3 and is deliberately NOT
a dependency). Full findings + measurements: **`PLAN_MESH_LANE.md`**.

- Nodes (category `mesh`, `catalog.py` §12b): `ImportMesh`, `ToMesh`, `MeshFix`
  (merge verts, drop dup/degenerate faces + stray shards, fill holes, fix normals),
  `MeshInspect` (text health report → wire into a `Display`), `ExportMesh`,
  `MeshUnion`/`MeshSubtract`/`MeshIntersect` + `MeshSimplify` (**manifold3d**,
  Apache-2.0), and `MeshToSolid` — the only bridge back, guarded by `max_tris`.
- **Two engine gotchas, both load-bearing** (measured — PLAN_MESH_LANE.md §9):
  `trimesh.Trimesh(...)` defaults to `process=True`, which re-merges manifold3d's
  already-welded output and **silently breaks the manifold** — `_from_manifold` must
  pass `process=False`. And a simplify tolerance at/above the part's wall thickness
  (volume/area) *tears the part apart* while the triangle count climbs, so
  `MeshSimplify` verifies its own result (volume drift + `decompose()` piece count)
  and raises rather than returning a broken mesh.
- `Transpiler._cast` only fires on the **item-access** branch: `multiple` collectors
  and `list_access` sockets skip it (as the B-Rep `Union`/`Subtract` already did), so
  `_mesh_bool` coerces every item with `_as_mesh` itself. A solid reaches `MeshUnion`
  uncast — by design, and there's a test pinning it.
- Runtime: the `Mesh` class in the transpiler PREAMBLE wraps a `trimesh.Trimesh`.
  It carries a `_noodle_mesh` marker because `mesh_extractor` runs as an imported
  module and *cannot* import a class that lives in the generated script's globals —
  so it duck-types instead of `isinstance`.
- **Transforms are NOT duplicated.** `Move`/`Rotate`/`Scale`/`Mirror` take a mesh
  directly: their `shape` socket lists `accepts=[…, WIRE_MESH]`, the PREAMBLE
  helpers branch on `_is_mesh` and apply a 4×4 (`_mesh_matrix`) instead of a
  `Location`, and `output_follows="shape"` carries the mesh type back out. There is
  no `MeshMove` and there must not be. (Arrays/Align don't take meshes yet — their
  templates still build `Pos(…) * shape` inline.) `_at` — the `origin` socket every
  primitive gets, wrapped on by the EMITTER, not by the template — branches the same
  way: a mesh can't be `.moved()` nor go in a `Compound`, so it takes a `_mesh_matrix`
  and many origins concatenate instead. A helper behind an `origin` node must
  therefore NOT place its own result, or the translation lands twice
  (`tests/test_polyhedron.py::test_origin_is_applied_exactly_once`).
  `Rotate` also takes an optional
  `pivot` point and an `about` select — world (global axis, the default) / part (own
  bbox centre) / group (collective centre; under fan-out the emitter hoists ONE
  `_pivot_of(…)` out of the lambda so the ensemble turns rigidly); centres are
  measured on the tessellation, like `PlaceOnBed`.
- **The cast is asymmetric on purpose.** `solid/surface → mesh` is automatic
  (tessellation: milliseconds, safely lossy) — drop a `Box` straight into a mesh
  input and it just works. `mesh → solid` is **not** a cast: rebuilding a B-Rep from
  triangles costs ~300s, so it must stay an explicit guarded node (`MeshToSolid`,
  phase 2), never an implicit coercion that hangs the app for five minutes because
  someone wired a mesh into a `Fillet`.
- Previews cost nothing: a mesh IS triangles, so `mesh_extractor` hands the arrays
  straight to the viewer with no tessellation step.
- Not yet built (phase 3): hull/smooth/split/refine, and meshes through
  `ArrayLinear`/`ArrayPolar`/`Align` (their templates still build `Pos(…) * shape`
  inline, so they need helpers first — the four core transforms already work).
  Isotropic remesh has no non-GPL implementation that survives a real part — see
  `PLAN_MESH_LANE.md` §5.
- Example graph: `cad_nodes/examples/mesh-lane.json` (seeded into `projects/`). Tests: `tests/test_mesh_lane.py`.

## 5d. Print physics (category `print`)

Five nodes that answer what a slicer never asks: **which way up, and why**
(`catalog.py` §12c, runtime in the PREAMBLE, full notes in **`PLAN_PRINT_PHYSICS.md`**).
A printed part is anisotropic — the bond between layers is worth roughly a third to two
thirds of the material within one — so orientation decides **where the part breaks**.

- `PlaceOnBed` (lowest point → z=0; serves BOTH lanes: it measures on the mesh and moves
  the original, so a solid stays a solid), `Drop` (PlaceOnBed as a scrubbable FALL: a
  `timeline` slider 0→1, analytic bounce with restitution fixed per `material` — plastic
  0.55, lead 0.08, rubber 0.85… — then, with `settle` on, the part TOPPLES for real:
  `_settle_plan` walks the quasi-static cascade on the convex hull (com outside the
  contact patch → tip about the nearest support edge until the next facet lands, ≤40
  steps, replayed partially at scrub time). The energy guard — every step must strictly
  lower the com — is what stops a sphere rolling forever while letting the edge-balanced
  cube go over; balanced ties resolve deterministically. t=1 is always fully at rest;
  optional `plane` input. Gizmo `kind:"timeline"` (nodes.html): Edit-on-canvas shows a
  Z-only translate arrow — pull the part down to advance t, lift to rewind, one part
  height ≈ the full slider; wired `t` locks it. LIVE REPLAY: `_drop` attaches the whole
  journey as data to its result (`_noodle_anim`: bounce segs + topple steps, world
  coords, baked t); `_preview_of` lifts it into previews[id].anim, and nodes.html
  (`dropMatrixAt`/`applyDropAnim`) replays any t as pure matrix math at 60fps while the
  slider or a wired Number Slider drags (drag anticipation — see §6b), mesh pose =
  M(t)·M(t_baked)⁻¹ —
  the engine re-bakes exactly when the drag settles. COLLISIONS: the `collide` toggle —
  off by default, it costs real compute — un-fans multiple shapes wired into one Drop
  into ONE scene (`_drop_collide` → `_dyn_sim`) and runs REAL rigid-body dynamics
  (pybullet, DIRECT mode): every part is its convex hull, they all fall TOGETHER —
  colliding mid-air, pushing each other over, tumbling, stacking — simulated once at a
  fixed 1/240s step (deterministic per scene) in MILLIMETRES directly (so the fixed
  collision margin is sub-micron, not the ~1mm it becomes when shrunk to metres; CCD +
  hull-volume masses), recorded as 60Hz keyframes per body until the scene sleeps
  (restitutionVelocityThreshold=100mm/s + friction/damping, ~0.6-1s). Each returned
  shape carries its own keyframe plan (`_noodle_anim` kind "keys"); mesh_extractor emits
  a `{kind:"Scene", bodies:[...]}` preview, viewer.js builds a Group of independently-
  posable meshes, and nodes.html (`keyInterp`/`sceneBodyPose`) replays the whole pile
  LIVE (lerp+slerp) while the slider drags. Limits: falling parts are hulls, chaotic like
  real falling. THE CONTAINER: the `container` socket is an IMMOVABLE collider the parts
  fall into — a bowl, a tray, a crate. It is the one body that is NOT hulled: bullet allows
  a concave triangle soup for STATIC bodies only (`GEOM_FORCE_CONCAVE_TRIMESH`, mass 0,
  `_static_colliders` feeds it in bed coordinates), so a bowl keeps its cavity and really
  cradles what you pour in — verified against the analytic seat, balls resting on a
  spherical inner wall to <0.03mm. Wiring one implies scene mode whatever the `collide`
  toggle says (the emitter un-fans on `collide or container`), so a SINGLE part falls in
  too — and then a plain preview carries an anim of kind "keys", which `applyDropAnim`
  routes to `sceneBodyPose` instead of `dropMatrixAt`. It is not an output; with no
  motion wired it never moves, so preview the bowl node itself. A MOVING CONTAINER
  (`ContainerMotion`, labelled **Motion** → the `motion` socket) is the exception, and
  §5d-bis below; the same node drives `Animate` with no physics at all (§5d-ter).
  GRIP: `grip` scales the friction of the whole
  scene (statics, parts, bed). It is not a detail — on a SLOPED static face high
  friction grabs a part and flings it sideways instead of letting it slide off, so
  `examples/galton-board.json` at grip 1 throws its balls to the walls (bimodal,
  hollow centre, gaussian fit −0.13) and at 0.15 gives a real bell (fit +0.81).
  MESH-LANE TRAP, paid for: `Mesh.__slots__` must list `_noodle_anim` (and now
  `_noodle_extra`). A build123d
  Shape takes any attribute, so the B-Rep lane carried the Drop timeline for free
  and nobody noticed that on the mesh lane the assignment hit the slots wall and was
  swallowed by `_drop`'s try/except — a dropped mesh simply never replayed, and a
  collide scene of meshes came back as one merged blob instead of N posable bodies),
  `PrintCheck` (report → Panel), `OverhangFaces`
  (the faces needing support, as a mesh of its own → its own colour in the viewer),
  `SupportVolume` (the support as a BODY), `OrientForPrint` (every stable pose scored; two
  outputs — the oriented mesh and the table saying why — from ONE search, via
  `_emit_orient`, modelled on `_emit_center`).
- **Support is a sweep and a boolean, not an estimate**: a prism from every overhanging
  triangle down to the bed, unioned (`manifold3d.batch_boolean`), minus the part *and the
  part shifted down by the clearance gap* (that second copy carves the space the support
  must leave, or it welds itself on). Checked against a pencil: a sphere of r=20 gives
  1.63 cm³ where the integral says 1.73. ~0.6 s at 20k triangles — so `OrientForPrint`
  uses it while the part is under `exact_below` triangles and the `area × height` proxy
  above, **all or nothing**, and the report says which. It is the ENVELOPE (a slicer fills
  it sparse) and it does not know about bridges — `PLAN_PRINT_PHYSICS.md` §5.
- **The weak plane** is the smallest cross-section perpendicular to Z: `manifold3d`'s
  `slice(z).area()` (~0.01 s for 80 sections, so scoring 100 poses is free). It is a
  property of the part *in this orientation*, and turning the part moves it.
- **Stable poses** = the convex-hull faces whose polygon contains the projected centre of
  mass — scipy, because trimesh's `compute_stable_poses` needs `networkx`+`shapely`, which
  are not in the image. Cluster hull normals by TOLERANCE, not by a rounded key.
- Two traps, both paid for: the faces resting **on the bed** must be excluded from the
  overhang (a flat base points down too, and counting it makes the one support-free
  orientation look worst), and `PlaceOnBed` must measure on the **tessellation**, not on
  `Shape.bounding_box()` — the fast OCCT box is oversized (hence `view.bbox.approx`), so a
  part dropped by it hovers above the bed.
- **Strength needs a load.** With a `load` vector the score is how much of it crosses the
  layers; with none declared the optimiser optimises for printability and will hand you the
  weakest possible part. That is the whole of `examples/print-orientation.json`.
- **§5d-bis. The container that MOVES** (`ContainerMotion` → `Drop.motion`): the bowl
  stops being furniture. It is a PRESCRIBED motion, not a simulated one — you dictate
  it and the parts inside answer only through contact and friction, which is why they
  lag, slide, climb the wall and spill instead of following rigidly. One node covers
  the lot because `cycles` picks the shape of the motion: 0 = a RAMP (tilt, pour, tip a
  crate) that goes there once and STAYS; >0 = an OSCILLATION about the start pose
  (shake, stir, vibrate) that always returns to it. `delay` waits (fill the bowl, THEN
  tilt); rotation is about the container's own centre unless a `pivot` is wired.
  - **`resetBaseVelocity` is load-bearing, and this was measured.**
    `resetBasePositionAndOrientation` ALONE does not carry the contents: it teleports
    the body, so the contact has zero relative velocity, friction has nothing to
    transmit and the tray slides out from under the part (a box on a tray translated
    50mm rode along **1.2%** — i.e. not at all). Pairing it with `resetBaseVelocity`
    every step gives **99.3%**. The obvious alternative — a real mass on a `JOINT_FIXED`
    constraint driven by `changeConstraint` — carries just as well (99.9%) and is still
    WRONG here: mass > 0 forbids `GEOM_FORCE_CONCAVE_TRIMESH`, so it would hull the bowl
    and throw away the cavity, which is the only reason `container` exists.
  - The motion is dictated in WORLD xyz and the colliders live in bed coordinates, so
    `_motion_driver` carries it over: `R_bed = Bᵀ R_world B`, and since bullet poses a
    body as `x → R x + pos`, turning about a pivot is ENTIRELY the `pos = p − R p` term
    (get it wrong and the bowl swings through the scene on an invisible arm).
  - **A driven rig must never let the scene fall asleep**: `_dyn_sim`'s 0.5s-of-calm
    exit would otherwise trigger BEFORE a slow tilt even begins and the pile would ride
    along frozen — hence the `tau <= _drive_until` guard, and `_t_max` grown to cover
    the motion. A shaker never settles, so it runs its full declared length.
  - **Drawing it needed no frontend change at all.** The container is not an output and
    must not become one, so the posed container rides the result as `_noodle_extra`;
    `mesh_extractor._preview_of` turns those into extra bodies of the same `Scene`
    preview, each with its own `kind:"keys"` track — which `viewer.js` already renders
    as independently-posable children and `sceneBodyPose` already replays at 60fps.
    A single part + a moving container is PROMOTED to a Scene for this reason (else the
    bowl would be invisible). Verified in the browser: scrubbing `t` moves all 4 bodies,
    bowl included. Preview the Drop, not the bowl, or you get a static ghost of it too.
  - **A finish PER BODY — the glass jar really does pour steel bolts.** A collide
    scene is ONE preview, so `finishOf(id)` used to resolve once for the whole
    pile and the container inherited the falling parts' material. Now each body
    can name the node that DREW it: the emitter reads the `container` socket off
    `graph.connections` and passes `{container_ids}` into `_drop` (only the
    emitter can know this — the runtime is handed a shape, never a graph),
    `_static_colliders` carries the id per collider, `_dyn_sim` stamps it on each
    extra as `_noodle_owner`, `mesh_extractor._preview_of` emits it as
    `body.owner`, and `objFromPreview`'s `bodies` branch resolves `colorOf` /
    `finishOf` from it. Bodies with no owner are the Drop's own output and keep
    the node-level look, so nothing changes for a scene without a container.
    - **`Mesh.__slots__` must list `_noodle_owner`**, exactly as it must list
      `_noodle_anim`: a build123d Shape takes any attribute, so the B-Rep lane
      works either way and the mesh lane silently drops it inside `_drop`'s
      `try/except`. The whole chain fails SILENTLY when any link is wrong —
      check `body.owner` in view.json before blaming the renderer.
    - The glow layer looks at body owners too, or an emissive container would
      light nothing (`renderPreviews` sets `glowing` from both).
    - Free side effect worth knowing: transmission costs a full scene re-render
      per transparent body, so making the CONTENTS opaque and leaving only the
      jar glass is also what makes the scene cheap enough to screenshot
      headlessly at all (§9 runs on SwiftShader, with no GPU).
  - Example: `examples/container-tilt.json` (balls land, then the bowl tips over its own
    rim and pours them out). Costs ~5ms per simulated second to drive.
- **§5d-ter. `Animate` — the same motion with NO physics.** A Motion turned out to be
  worth having on its own: a lid unscrewing off a jar, a drawer sliding out, a hinge
  swinging, a part lifted clear of an assembly. `Animate(shape, motion, t)` just MOVES
  the shape along the plan and `t` scrubs it. Drop asks *what would happen*; Animate
  says *do this*. Because of that the `ContainerMotion` node is now labelled just
  **Motion** (the TYPE string is unchanged — saved graphs and `_container_motion` keep
  their names; only the label and the aliases moved).
  - **It cost almost nothing to build, and that is the design.** A screw needs no new
    vocabulary because the plan already advances translation and rotation on ONE
    phase: `move z 12` + `rotate z 720`, `cycles 0`, and the cap rises as it turns.
    The pose comes from the same `_motion_driver`, called with an identity bed frame
    (`B = I`, `o = 0`) and the shape's own tessellated bbox centre as the pivot — the
    same reason `PlaceOnBed` measures on the tessellation: the fast OCCT box is
    oversized and an off-centre axis is exactly what an unscrewing lid cannot afford.
  - **It bakes keyframes rather than staying analytic**, and that is why the frontend
    change was three lines: the browser already replays a `kind:"keys"` plan at 60fps
    (`sceneBodyPose`, built for collide scenes), so `_animate` samples `pose(tau)` at
    60Hz (≥24 samples per oscillation cycle, capped at 2000) and ships it as
    `_noodle_anim`. No new format, no new replay path. What DID have to change:
    `applyLocalTransform`/`applyDropTargets` keyed on `cadType === 'Drop'` — now on
    `TIMELINE_NODES`, or Animate would be correct and silently un-scrubbable. Measured
    in the browser: scrubbing its own `t` = 60fps replay + exactly ONE re-bake at
    settle; a Number Slider wired into `t` = 0 runs.
  - **It must NOT copy Drop's un-fan.** A Drop gathers several shapes into one scene
    because they have to collide with each other; nothing here interacts, so five lids
    wired in are five independent movements — the ordinary fan-out rule. Equally: no
    `container`, no `collide`, no `grip`, no `material`. Everything that costs compute
    stays in Drop. Both share one Motion node, and one `t` slider can drive both.
  - **`hold` exists because of how the live scrub finds its targets.** One slider driving
    a 1.2s unscrew AND an 8s pour needs the two timelines to be the same LENGTH — and the
    obvious fix, rescaling `t` through a `Remap`, silently costs you the 60fps replay:
    `applyDropTargets` follows DIRECT links from the dragged value node into a `t` socket
    and cannot evaluate a node in between (nor should it — that would mean reimplementing
    engine math in JS). So Animate pads its own timeline with stillness after the motion
    instead, and the wire stays direct. Past `end` the phase already parks (at the
    destination for a ramp, at the start for an oscillation), so holding is free and
    exact. **Pad the short clock; never rescale the wire.**
  - Examples: `examples/jar-cap-unscrew.json` (the bare mechanism — scrub `t` and the cap
    spins up off its thread) and `examples/threaded-jar-pour.json`, where it earns its
    keep: ONE slider unscrews the golden cap (Animate, 0.4s delay + 0.8s + 6.8s hold =
    8.0s) and then tips the glass jar (Drop + container motion, T = 7.9875s) so six
    rainbow bolts pour out and fall to the bed. Verified in the browser: dragging that
    one slider moves the cap and all seven scene bodies at 60fps, with exactly one
    re-bake at settle. Both lanes — a solid stays a solid.

## 5e. Voronoi 3D + universal Populate

`PopulateGeometry` (display "Populate") and `Voronoi3D` are the point→partition
pair. Helpers in the transpiler PREAMBLE; both stay memo-cacheable because the
seed lives *inside* the helper (`np.random.RandomState`), not on the emitted line
(`_MEMO_NONDET` matches emitted-line substrings only).

- **Populate is universal** — one node, one `region` socket (`raw=True`,
  `accepts=[solid, mesh]`), dispatching in `_populate` on the runtime TOPOLOGY of
  what's wired (not duck-typing `position_at` — Edge *and* Face have one):
  nothing → the legacy `0..w × 0..h` box at z=0 (bit-exact with the old node);
  **open curve → 1D** along it, uniform by arc length (`edge.position_at(t)`, t is
  already normalized arc length); **closed curve / flat XY face → 2D** *really
  inside* the region (`Face.is_inside`, top-up rounds — not just its bbox); **curved
  face → 2.5D** on the surface, uniform by area (`trimesh.sample.sample_surface`);
  **solid / watertight mesh → 3D** inside the volume. The `raw` socket is
  load-bearing: without it the `curve→surface` (`_face`) and `solid→mesh`
  (`_to_mesh`) casts would fire at the wire and the helper could never tell a curve
  from a face. A *closed* curve is re-filled inside the helper (`_face`) — the
  legacy Rectangle/Circle-as-boundary idiom — while an open one scatters along.
- **3D volume fill has no rtree** (`trimesh.contains` needs it, absent from the
  image): point-in-mesh is `_winding_inside` — the generalized winding number in
  pure numpy (|w|>0.25 = inside), run on a manifold3d-simplified *proxy* when the
  mesh is heavy (>4k tris; it's only an inside oracle, so no verification like
  MeshSimplify does). Rejection loop, 24 rounds, then a clear "run Mesh Fix" error.
- **Voronoi3D** (`mesh` category, list output `cells`): `scipy.spatial.Voronoi` in
  3D with sites mirrored across the **6 planes** of the domain box (body bbox if
  wired, else the points' extent — the 3D analog of `_voronoi2d`'s mirror trick) so
  every kept cell is finite. Each cell = its Voronoi vertices, shrunk toward the
  centroid by `scale`, hulled straight into a Manifold (`Manifold.hull_points` — a
  Voronoi cell is convex, the hull IS the cell), then `cell ^ body`. Output is a
  list of `mesh` bodies (downstream is booleans; `MeshToSolid` is the explicit
  bridge back to B-Rep). Coplanar/degenerate points → clear `QhullError`-wrapped
  ValueError; cap 2000 points. ~0.1s for 60 cells clipped to a 5k-tri sphere.
- **The lattice** = Populate(volume of a body) → Voronoi3D(same body, scale<1) →
  `MeshSubtract` the shrunk cells from the body: the walls *between* cells become
  the part. `examples/voronoi-3d-lattice.json`. Tests:
  `tests/test_populate_voronoi3d.py` (pure-Python: wire shape + emission).

## 5f. Union fuses, Join sews — and they are different OCCT operations

A boolean merges shapes that **overlap** (`+`, BRepAlgoAPI); sewing stitches shapes
that merely **share a border** (BRepBuilderAPI_Sewing, reached through
`Face.sew_faces`/`Shell`, and `Wire.combine` for edges). Union used to be asked for
both and silently answered the second one wrong: two faces on different planes came
back as `f0 + f1` — a loose `Sketch` of 2 faces, no shell, no error, and in the
viewport it *looks* joined.

- **`Join`** (`boolean` category, `_join` in the PREAMBLE): one collector, curves +
  surfaces + solids. Faces win over edges when a shape has both (an input with faces
  is a surface; its edges are that surface's border). Six box faces → a closed shell
  → a real `Solid`; five → an open `Shell` (previewed fine, 4 triangles for an L).
  The closed test is load-bearing: `Solid(open_shell)` builds happily and returns an
  **invalid** solid (measured: volume 800 on a 1000 box) rather than raising.
  Pieces that do not touch are an **error**, not a silent Compound — that is the
  entire point of the node. `tolerance` reaches `Wire.combine` only; `sew_faces`
  has no tolerance argument and uses OCCT's own.
- **`Union` refuses what it cannot fuse**: when every atom is a face, `_coplanar_check`
  requires them planar and on one plane, else it raises and names Join. Solids are
  untouched (disjoint solids fusing into a multi-piece part stays legal and is used),
  and coplanar region merges keep working — `lego-brick` fuses `Text` glyph fragments
  that way, `axl cage` fuses `MakeFace`/`Fillet2D` output. Curves never could reach
  Union: there is no `curve→solid` cast, so `validate()` rejects the wire.
- Tests: `tests/test_join.py` (pure-Python contract); the sewing itself is exercised
  in the worker.

**What Join feeds — and three traps found downstream of it.** The obvious next node
after joining faces is `Shell` (thicken the open surface) or `Shell By Faces`:

- **A failed `Solid.thicken` POISONS its input.** BRepOffset registers its
  modifications on the input faces' TShapes, so a thicken that fails corrupts those
  faces for every node still holding them — measured: `Polyhedron → Join(all but one
  face) → Shell` made the *sibling* `Shell By Faces`, hollowing the same polyhedron
  through the left-out face, return volume **4728 on a part of 2536**, invalid,
  instead of 432. `_thicken` thickens a `deepcopy`. Same family as the `_reanchor`
  trap: OCCT hands out shared topology and a node must not scribble on what it did
  not build.
- **OCCT cannot thicken every open shell**, and says so badly: it returns a SHELL
  when it could not close the wall, and build123d's blind `TopoDS.Solid(...)` cast
  turns that into `Standard_TypeMismatch: TopoDS::Solid`. Sharp dihedral angles
  between many facets are its weak spot — of the platonic solids minus a face, the
  tetra/cube/dodeca thicken fine and the **octa/icosa never do**, at any tolerance,
  join mode or thickness (all swept). `_thicken` now raises a readable error naming
  the way that does work, and refuses to return a wall that fails `is_valid` (it
  renders like a part without being one).
- **`_shell_faces` used to swallow its own failure** (`except Exception: return
  _part`) — no error, no hollow, a node that quietly handed back its input. That is
  what an open surface wired into `Shell By Faces` did. It now rejects a non-solid
  with a message and propagates a real offset failure.
- **The route that works** for a hollow polyhedron with an opening: hollow the CLOSED
  solid and pick the openings there — `Polyhedron → FacesByArea/FacesByNormal →
  ShellByFaces`. Verified end-to-end (icosahedron, wall 0.5 → volume 432.1, valid,
  watertight) and on every platonic solid. Do NOT remove the faces first.

## 5g. Threads (category `fastener`)

One node, `Thread`, makes a real screw thread — ISO metric, trapezoidal lead
screw, UNC/UNF, ACME, tapered NPT — male or female, multi-start, left or right
handed. Runtime in the transpiler PREAMBLE (`_thread`), full notes and every
measurement in **`PLAN_THREADS.md`**. It is on the MESH lane, and that is the
whole story:

- **build123d 0.11 has no thread primitive** (they live in `bd_warehouse`, not a
  dependency), and OCCT cannot be made to do it. The helical sweep is fast on
  either lane (~0.03s), but fusing the rib to its core through the B-Rep kernel
  costs 2-8s and **gets it wrong without raising**: M6x1 came back as the bare
  core (volume 227.9, the thread silently gone) and M20x2.5 came back with volume
  **0**. Letting the section abut the core instead of overlapping it does not even
  build (`StdFail_NotDone`). manifold3d does the same union in ~0.02s, watertight,
  major diameter exact to 4 decimals.
- **Every family is the same trapezoid** with different numbers (half angle, crest
  flat, depth, taper), so one section builder covers all four. Inch sizes are
  stored as they are quoted (inches + TPI) and converted once — never transcribed.
- **Male and female differ ONLY in the root truncation** (17H/24 vs 15H/24 on the
  60° families). The `internal` result is not a female thread, it is **the TAP**:
  subtract it and it drills the hole and cuts the thread in one go.
- **`clearance` loosens the thread it is set on** — set it on ONE half of a pair or
  you get double the gap. Measured on M6x1 by boolean interference: tangent by
  construction at 0, free from 0.1mm up (residuals ≤0.013mm³ = 0.006% of the
  thread, non-monotone in facet count and sometimes negative — numerical noise,
  not contact). 0.3 is the FDM default because the printer's error dwarfs the
  model's.
- **An inverted winding is silent and catastrophic**: manifold3d reads it as
  NEGATIVE volume and SUBTRACTS the rib. The first build returned a M6 rod of
  180.5mm³ against a bare core of 227.9 — smaller than its own core, watertight,
  no error. The faces are reversed once, deliberately, with a comment.
- **The placement socket is `at`, NOT `origin`** — and a new node with an optional
  `shape` should copy this. The emitter wraps an `origin` socket around the node's
  WHOLE result (§4 / `_at`), which with `shape` wired would move the finished
  assembly, so a tapped hole could never leave the axis. `_thread` takes the point
  itself and places the thread BEFORE the boolean. Free bonus: a **list** of points
  drills a whole pattern of tapped holes in one node.
- Example: `examples/bolt-and-nut.json` (a bolt whose thread ADDS to its shank, a
  nut whose thread CUTS). Tests: `tests/test_thread.py`. Agent-facing usage:
  AGENT_HELP topic `threads`.

## 5h. Fluids (category `fluid`) — moving air, and what it does to a part

Two nodes, one shared idea. **`Wind`** is a PLAN, not geometry — a plain dict, exactly
like `ContainerMotion` (§5d-bis) — so it costs nothing and drives two different
consumers. `Drop` asks *what happens to my part in this wind* (rigid bodies pushed by a
fluid they do not disturb); **`WindTunnel`** asks the opposite, *what does the part do
to the fluid*, and actually solves it (D3Q19 Lattice-Boltzmann in numpy, in the worker).
No GPU, no OpenCL, no second image, no job queue — measured, ~20s at the default
quality, and the memo cache pays for it once. Full notes and every measurement in
**`PLAN_FLUID.md`** (§7 is the implementation record).

- **THE BUG THAT WAS ALREADY THERE, and it is not about fluids**: `createMultiBody`
  builds a **btMultiBody**, which carries a hard-wired `m_maxCoordinateVelocity` of 100
  units/s — in millimetres, **10 cm/s**. Measured: a body released in vacuum held
  exactly −100.0 mm/s for the whole drop instead of accelerating, so gravity was off in
  all but name in EVERY collide scene, and nobody saw it because the timeline is
  normalised and a slow-motion fall shown end to end reads as plausible.
  `useMaximalCoordinates=True` makes it a btRigidBody: the same body then gives
  −3270 / −6540 / −9810 mm/s at t = 1/3, 2/3, 1, free fall to the digit, and a 900→100mm
  drop takes 0.40s against 0.40s analytic. Drag needed it more than anything (it goes as
  v², and under the clamp it could not reach a thousandth of a part's weight). It is
  retroactive: `container-tilt`, `drop-stack`, `threaded-jar-pour` were re-run and
  LOOKED AT and are fine, but **`galton-board`'s gaussian fit drops from +0.81 to
  +0.47** — still a bell, correctly tuned (four material/grip combinations tried, the
  current one wins), just built against the old wrong physics.
- **Everything is expressed relative to the PART's density** (`_medium_units`), and that
  is the whole reason buoyancy comes out right. `_dyn_sim` works in mm with
  `baseMass = hull volume`, i.e. every part has density 1 mass-unit/mm³ BY CONSTRUCTION.
  Gravity and contact never notice (both are invariant under a global mass scaling) but
  buoyancy and drag depend on the ABSOLUTE ratio — get the units wrong and wood sinks
  while every test still passes. So `rho_rel = rho_fluid/rho_material`, nothing touches
  `baseMass`, and **a vacuum cancels every added force exactly**, which is what makes
  the change safe for existing scenes.
- **A silhouette cannot make anything turn.** The first drag table projected the hull
  per direction: areas correct (20.0× between a plate's largest and smallest, 1.00 for a
  sphere) but **every centre of pressure came out exactly zero**, because for a centrally
  symmetric body the silhouette's centroid IS the projected centre of mass. A plate would
  never have flipped. `_body_aero` now integrates over the hull's FACES (Newtonian panel
  drag): same cost, and the force stops being parallel to the wind — an inclined surface
  gets a sideways push 0.90× the along-flow one at 45°, which is what makes a card fly.
  Area still equals the silhouette exactly (a cube gives 400.00 for a 20mm face).
- **A gas has no free surface; a liquid does.** Scaling drag by a submerged fraction that
  air does not have made a 12 m/s wind move a plate by ONE MILLIMETRE. `_MEDIUM` carries
  an `is_liquid` flag: a liquid fills up to `level`, a gas fills everything. And without
  a `level` a buoyant part never stops rising — measured, a wooden cube reached z=858.
  With it, wood settles 63% submerged against 60% theoretical.
- **A wired Wind, or any non-vacuum medium, turns scene mode on by itself**, in BOTH the
  emitter and `_drop`'s dispatch. The analytic path has nowhere to apply a force, so a
  wind reaching it would be ignored in silence. And a Wind with the default `vacuum`
  medium would blow on nothing, so a wind implies air unless something denser was chosen.
- **The sleep guard lost its `_pose` test**: `if tau <= _drive_until` rather than
  `if _pose is not None and tau <= _drive_until`. A gust that starts late finds the pile
  asleep, exactly as a slowly tilting tray did. Backward-compatible by construction —
  with the 0.0 default it is true only at k=0, where `still` is already 0.
- **The bounce-back SIGN is the whole solver.** `np.roll(A, s)[x]` is `A[x-s]`, so the
  neighbour at `x + c[q]` is `roll(solid, -c[q])`. With `+c[q]` the link set is mirrored,
  reflected populations land on the wrong cells and **mass is destroyed instead of
  bounced**: density drained from step one, went negative by step six, and the drag came
  back `nan`. It looked like a stability problem — it diverged at EVERY tau, including
  0.70 — and it was not.
- **Cd is only comparable at the same Reynolds, and the report says so in six lines.**
  With the sign fixed a sphere gives Cd 1.37 at Re 159 against Schiller-Naumann's 0.89
  (1.54×, inside the factor-2 gate), but the teardrop < sphere < cube ordering still
  fails — because each body lands at a DIFFERENT Re (86, 159, 183), and at these Re the
  Cd runs as ~24/Re. The gate that passes is the PAIRED one: the same body turned around,
  same grid, same Re. That one also corrected me — tail-downstream 1.157 beats
  nose-upstream 1.314, because a teardrop is round in front and pointed behind.
- **Voxelisation is shell-raster + flood-fill, never the winding number** (measured 8.65s
  against 0.017s at 64×32×32 — the bridge cost more than the solver). `_winding_inside`
  stays PopulateGeometry's point-in-mesh oracle; it is not a voxeliser.
- **Streamlines are `Spline`s, one edge each, decimated to ≤32 points.** `_polylines_of`
  samples EVERY EDGE at 33 points, so a `Polyline` of 120 points is 119 edges and 3927
  points on the wire — 236k for sixty lines. A list of build123d curves then previews for
  free (`_as_shape` compounds it, `_polylines_of` walks its edges): **frontend zero**,
  as PLAN_FLUID promised. Seeds sit at 30–70% of the inlet, not across it — the domain is
  4 body widths wide and a full-span grid draws a page of straight rules.
- `WindTunnel` needs a custom emitter (`_emit_windtunnel`, modelled line for line on
  `_emit_orient`): one solve, two outputs registered in `out_var_of`, `_rep = None`
  pre-declared OUTSIDE the guard. Twenty seconds is too much to spend twice because a
  Panel is wired in.
- Examples: `examples/wind-drop.json` (the same plate twice, one facing the gust and one
  edge-on: 59mm of drift and flat on the bed against 0.1mm and still standing) and
  `examples/wind-tunnel.json`. Tests: `tests/test_fluid.py`. Agent-facing
  usage: AGENT_HELP topic `fluid`.

## 5b. Lists & fan-out (Grasshopper-style)

Inputs have a data-access mode (`Socket.list_access`):

- **item-access** (default): the input FANS OUT. Wire several connections into it
  (shift-drag in the editor) — or feed it a list-producing node — and the node
  runs once per item, producing a **list** output. Two points → one Circle → two
  circles. Scalars broadcast; shorter lists reuse their last item (longest-match).
- **list_access** (`Socket("list", …, list_access=True)`) and every `multiple`
  collector: consume the whole list as one value (List/Sort/Item/Slice…, Loft).

**Params as inputs:** an input socket that shares a param's name overrides the
widget when wired, and falls back to it when not (e.g. `Vector`/`ConstructPoint`
x/y/z, `Move` `offset`). Wire a list into such an input and the node fans out —
`Range → ConstructPoint.x → Move.offset` scatters one copy per position.

The transpiler wraps a fanned node as `_fanout(lambda …: <expr>, {…})` and tracks
which node outputs are lists (`_produces_list` + `_LIST_PRODUCERS`) so lists
propagate down a chain. List nodes live in the `data` category (ListCreate,
ListSort, ListItem, ListReverse, ListSlice, First/Last, Flatten, Concat, …);
`_sort` uses build123d `ShapeList.sort_by` for shapes, Python `sorted` otherwise.
Other list-producers: `Voronoi2D` (scipy → cell faces), `Voronoi3D` (scipy 3D +
`manifold3d.hull_points`/boolean → convex mesh **cells** clipped to a body, §5e),
`DivideSurface` (`Face.position_at` UV grid → points), `PopulateGeometry`
(universal scatter, §5e) — all fan out downstream (Extrude per cell, scatter per
point). scipy/numpy are available in the worker.
Frontend multi-connect = dynamic input slots sharing one socket name (see
`onConnectionsChange` + `fromGraphJSON` in `nodes.html`).

## 6. How to change things

**Add or edit a node** — almost always pure data in `catalog.py`:

```python
register(NodeDef("MyNode", "category", "My Node",
    inputs=[Socket("shape", WIRE_SOLID), Socket("plane", WIRE_PLANE, required=False)],
    params=[_f("amount", 1.0, 0.0, 100)],          # _f/_i = float/int slider helpers
    outputs=_geo(),                                 # _geo/_sk = solid/surface output
    code_template={"algebra": "my_op({shape}, {amount})"},
    description="..."))
```

`{socket}` → the upstream variable; `{param}` → the formatted value. If the node
needs runtime logic that doesn't fit one expression, add a helper to the
transpiler **PREAMBLE** and call it from the template (e.g. `_bbox_plane`,
`_rotate`). Wire compatibility changes go in `cad_nodes/casts.py` (§5) — the
frontend picks them up from `/api/wiretypes`.

**Search aliases.** `aliases=[…]` adds the words a user from another CAD would type into
the add-node search (`Split` answers to "cut" and "trim"): litegraph 0.7.18
matches ONLY the registered type path and its `searchbox_extras` are gated by the
same test, so nodes.html overrides the canvas INSTANCE's `onSearchBox`
(`nodeSearchRows` — the constructor sets `this.onSearchBox = null`, which would
shadow the prototype) and matches type + label + aliases itself.

**Personal aliases** are the same idea, user-side and hot: a node's right-click
menu → "🔎 Search aliases…" opens a chip modal (`editAliases`) where the built-in
ones sit LOCKED next to yours, which carry a red ✕. Every add/remove PUTs the
whole personal list to `/api/aliases/{type}` and re-draws from the response (so
the chips show what is really stored, server-side normalisation included; a
failed save rolls them back). That writes `projects/_aliases.json` (`{node_type: [word, …]}` — a file, so the
project/library listings that filter on `is_dir()` never see it; `_`-prefixed, so
`validate_graph_id` can never let a project collide with it). The editor loads
them at boot into `USER_ALIASES` and `aliasesOf()` merges the two lists, ranked
alike. The file is deliberately plain and greppable: **a word that earns its keep
gets promoted BY HAND into `NodeDef.aliases`** in catalog.py, and dropped from the
JSON. Catalog aliases are shown in the modal but never editable there — code owns them.

**Group nodes** (BuildPart/BuildSketch) use `is_group=True` + a `builder`
template and emit nested `with` blocks — see existing examples.

A child is substituted INLINE into the parent's `with` block instead of being
emitted as a statement of its own, and that one difference hid two bugs for a
long time — **no saved project uses a group**, so nothing exercised the path
(`tests/test_group_children.py` now does):

- **A child used to lose every parameter.** `_input_values` reports `"None"` for
  each UNWIRED socket, but a socket sharing a param's name must fall back to the
  widget (params-as-inputs, §5b). `_emit_simple` had that rule inline; the group
  path merged blindly over it, so a child came out `Box(None, None, None)` and
  the group died with an OCCT constructor TypeError. Both paths now go through
  `_merge_inputs`, so the rule lives in ONE place.
- **A child emitted no progress events**, so a BuildPart of twenty nodes lit one
  glow while the twenty stayed dark all run. Children can't be `_guard`ed (they
  are not statements), so they bracket themselves: `_ev('s'/'e')` inline, plus an
  inner try/except that REPORTS and re-raises — a failing child still fails its
  group exactly as before, but it no longer unwinds past its own start event and
  leaves that node breathing amber forever. On a memo HIT the block is skipped
  entirely, so `_guard(sub_ids=…)` reports the children cached too; without that
  they would light on a cold run and go dark on every warm one, which is
  indistinguishable from the glow failing at random.

### 6b. Drag anticipation (the old ✥ fastDrag)

It is **not a mode of its own**: `fastDrag()` in nodes.html is `liveMode &&
fastEnabled`, so turning Live on turns it on. `fastEnabled` is the escape hatch
for a slow machine (Settings ⚙ checkbox, persisted in localStorage
`noodle:settings:fastDrag`, default on) — with it off, Live still works, it just
waits for each run. There is no toolbar button any more.

The contract: while a param drags, replay it locally in Three.js; when the drag
settles, `scheduleLive()` re-bakes it exactly. The local replay must therefore be
an *anticipation of the engine's answer*, never a different one.

**When you add a node, ask whether it can be anticipated.** Compatibility is
decided at DRAG TIME, not at node creation — it depends on the wiring and on
whether a preview mesh exists, so it cannot be a static flag on the NodeDef:

- `applyLocalTransform(node)` — the node's own preview moved as a delta from the
  baked params. Today: Move/Rotate/Scale (a `Location`) and the `TIMELINE_NODES`
  — Drop and Animate — replaying the `_noodle_anim` they ship. Add a node here
  only if the transform is expressible as a matrix on the already-meshed preview.
- `applyDropTargets(node)` — a value node (Number Slider…) wired into the `t` of a
  timeline node, which replays each target instead of itself.

- `applyBoolAnticipation(node)` — **booleans downstream of the dragged node**, redone
  on meshes in the browser with manifold-wasm (`webui/anticipate.js`, vendored
  `manifold-3d` 3.5.4, Apache-2.0 — the same library as the mesh lane). The reason:
  on `raccordo` a Fillet radius re-runs in 19ms and then waits ~800ms for the Union
  and Subtract after it, plus ~330ms of meshing/transport, so the node you touch is
  never the cost. `plan()` finds the chain from the dragged node to what is drawn;
  the inputs the drag cannot change are fetched ONCE per drag as baked meshes
  (`POST /api/graph/{name}/anticipate` → `executor.operand_meshes`: a side run pruned
  to their ancestors, all memo hits, `publish=False` — ~150ms), then each animation
  frame re-evaluates the chain and swaps the drawn geometry; `renderPreviews` puts
  the baked geometry back when the exact re-bake lands. Supported: Move, Rotate
  (world, no pivot), Union, Subtract, Intersect, Box/Cylinder/Sphere (no `origin`,
  arc 360) and value nodes into their pins — anything else in the chain refuses the
  plan. Measured on raccordo: ~55ms per frame, bbox identical to the re-bake and
  volume within −0.2…−0.8% (chordal error of the tessellated cylinders), 0
  `/execute` during the drag. Per frame the boolean with the helical thread costs
  25ms and `calculateNormals` 16ms; the cylinder booleans ~1ms each.
  Tests: `tests/ui/anticipate.test.cjs`, `tests/test_anticipate.py`.

All three return **false** when they cannot help, and the caller falls through to the
plain debounced re-run. That fallback is what makes an unanticipated node correct
but merely slower — so when in doubt, return false. A node that anticipates
WRONGLY is far worse than one that does not anticipate at all.

**Never build a preview key by hand — `graphIdOf(node)` is the only way across.**
`previewMeshes` and `previewAnims` are keyed by the **on-disk graph id** (viewer.js
keys `meshes[id]` by the `view.previews` key); a litegraph node carries a separate
**runtime** id. As `nodeFor`'s comment already said, those "coincide only by luck" —
and every replay/gizmo call site was building `'n'+node.id` anyway. It worked on a
graph the editor had saved and reloaded in one go, which is why every test of the
scrub passed, and it broke everywhere else — including on every hand-authored
example, whose ids are words like `drop`. **Measured on `examples/threaded-jar-pour`:
the Drop (runtime 30) looked up `n30` while its mesh sat under `n29`, and a Number
Slider (runtime 31) resolved `n31` — the TORUS's mesh.** So the failure mode is not
merely a lost 60fps scrub: a false hit hands a node ANOTHER node's geometry to
transform, and the Move/Rotate/Scale gizmo reads the same map. It also cost a full
12-minute screen recording that looked plausible until the frames were examined —
the cap unscrewed (its ids happened to match) while the jar never tipped.
`graphIdOf` / `previewMeshOf` / `previewAnimOf` are now the only readers;
`tests/test_print.py::test_the_live_replay_resolves_meshes_by_ON_DISK_id` pins that
no caller reconstructs the key, because this failed **silently** and would return
the same way.

### 6c. Node size & `arrange()` — why a graph you generate stops overlapping itself

A node's on-canvas size is computed by **litegraph, in the browser**, from its
socket and widget count — and, except for a resized sticky `Note`, it is never
written to graph.json. So everything that placed nodes server-side (`api.add_node`,
the copilot's 6-column grid, an agent writing graph.json by hand) was placing boxes
whose height it could not know. Measured on the 58 saved projects: **539 pairs of
nodes overlapping**, hiding each other.

`cad_nodes/layout.py` fixes the cause, not the symptom.

- **`node_size(ndef, node=None)` mirrors `LGraphNode.computeSize` exactly**, and is
  pinned to reality rather than to itself: `scripts/capture_node_sizes.py` drops one
  node of every registered type into a throwaway project, opens it in a headless
  browser and reads `node.size` back out of the live editor into
  `tests/fixtures/node_sizes.json`; `tests/test_layout.py` then asserts — pure
  Python, no browser — that the model reproduces all 188. **If that test fails,
  layout.py is wrong, not the fixture.** Re-run the capture after changing how
  nodes.html builds sockets or widgets.
- **The terms that a naive estimate gets wrong**, and they dominate: a float/int
  param with BOTH min and max makes **two** widgets (the cadslider *and* the ✎
  field); a `note` param makes **none**; and every fan-out-capable input carries a
  `＋ name` toggle, which is a widget too. A `Vector` is 9 widgets and ~314px tall,
  not the ~190 you would guess — which is exactly why `copilot.py`'s 180px row pitch
  overlaps by construction.
- **`node.position` is the BODY's top-left**; litegraph draws the title bar in the
  30px ABOVE it. `node_box()` accounts for it — ignore it and titles collide while
  the arithmetic says they don't.
- **`arrange(graph)`** (also `api.arrange`): longest-path layering → column, barycentre
  ordering within a column to cut crossings, then stacking on the real sizes. It
  **asserts zero overlaps before returning** — a silent collision is the one outcome
  it exists to prevent.
- **Groups are the trap.** Membership is purely geometric (a group is a bare
  rectangle, there is no member list), so `arrange` resolves membership BEFORE moving
  anything and re-fits the boxes after. That alone is not enough: the barycentre
  happily interleaves two groups down the same columns, and the boxes refitted around
  them come out **cutting across each other** — visually worse than the unarranged
  graph even though no two nodes collide. So each group also gets its own y-**band**,
  packed per column. Across all saved projects that took group-box collisions from 43
  to 2 (the survivors are graphs whose groups genuinely interleave in the dependency
  order); it is reported as `group_overlaps`, not raised, since the nodes are still
  correctly placed. Containment (a nested group) is not a collision.
- Found while building it, because the model disagreed with the editor by exactly 96px:
  `_curvePreviewH` was applied **only in the node constructor**, so a `GraphMapper`
  rendered correctly when dropped and, after save+reload, drew its curve mini-preview
  **on top of its own widgets**. All five `computeSize` call sites in nodes.html are
  now one `resizeNode()` helper.
- **Reaching it**: `⊞ Riordina` in the toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+A) → `POST /api/graph/
  {name}/arrange`, or `api.arrange` for MCP/agents. The route has two modes and the
  distinction matters: **with a graph body** it arranges THAT graph and returns it,
  touching nothing on disk — which is what the editor posts, because the open canvas
  may not be what is saved and arranging the stored copy would discard unsaved edits
  and desync undo. **With no body** it loads, arranges and saves, for an agent or a
  curl. The button applies the result through `fromGraphJSON` and then
  `recordHistory()`, so Ctrl+Z puts every node back; it deliberately does NOT
  `scheduleLive()` — moving a node cannot change the model.

### 6c-bis. 🎨 Aspetto — one modal for colour, finish and wireframe

A node's right-click menu used to carry three separate entries for how it LOOKS: a
Wireframe toggle and two submenus. Their common flaw was that you could not see
the result without closing them first. They are replaced by one live modal
(`editAppearance`, `nodes.html`); the old entries are gone and a test pins that.

- **UI-only.** The state model is unchanged — `previewColor` / `previewFinish` /
  `wireframe` on the node, `color` / `finish` / `wireframe` in graph.json. No
  migration, nothing else in the app has to know.
- **Live, because it costs nothing.** These three never reach the transpiler —
  the generated source is byte-identical with and without them (pinned in
  `tests/test_print.py`), which is also why editing them never invalidates the
  memo cache. So every click is a `refreshDisplay()` (re-render the last view),
  never a run. Cancel/Esc restores the state captured on open, and the whole
  visit is ONE undo step, not one per click.
- **A multi-selection is styled together** — the submenus could not do that.
- **Per PIECE, and it needed no new state.** Since §5d-bis every body of a collide
  scene names the node that DREW it (`body.owner`), so "glass jar, metal bolts"
  was already expressible per node — but only if you knew to open the modal on
  the CONTAINER's node, whose own preview is usually switched off. Nobody guesses
  that. `piecesOf(node)` groups the last view's bodies by owner, and when there is
  more than one the modal shows a **Pezzo** row that retargets it. Switching
  re-reads that node's own values (showing the previous piece's colour would be a
  lie), and Cancel restores every piece VISITED, not just the one on screen. It
  is a view onto the per-node fields that already exist — no per-body override
  map, so graph.json is untouched and a test pins that no such state was invented.
- Giving ONE bolt of a fan-out its own material is still absent: those are one
  node by construction, and telling them apart would need real per-body state
  with an answer for what happens when the count changes. `rainbow` remains that
  answer.
- Tests: `tests/test_appearance.py`.

### 6d. Naming a node — and the input panel

There is a per-node `title` (`Node.title`, persisted only when it differs from the
type's label). It is documentation on any node, and on a **pure parameter source**
(`category == "input"`: Number Slider, Integer, Number, Boolean, String) it is also
a promotion: `arrange()` lifts every NAMED one out of the dependency flow and stacks
it in a panel at the left, one click away.

- **Naming is the whole mark, and that is the point.** Every knob in a graph is
  called "Number Slider" until you rename it, so "has a name" already separates the
  parameters the user cares about from the scratch ones — no second piece of UI, and
  the panel comes out exactly as long as the labelling you bothered to do.
- **Sorted by name, which is also how you order it**: prefix the names and they sort
  that way. Rename with `✎ Rinomina…` in the node's right-click menu or **F2**;
  clearing the field restores the type's label (and drops `title` from graph.json).
- **An explicitly GROUPED node is left where it is** — putting a node in a group is a
  stronger statement about where it belongs than naming it is.
- **The title feeds litegraph's width**, so `node_size()` measures a renamed node with
  its own name; forgetting that would desync the model from the editor for exactly
  the nodes this feature creates. Verified against the browser: a 42-character name
  gives 361.20000 in Python against 361.20001 on the canvas.
- Still open: a graph with many UNNAMED sources still stacks them all in column 0, so
  the result stays tall and narrow (`retromy`: 2010×8179). Naming them is the fix,
  and now it is available.

**Straighter wires, auto groups** (`layout.py`, measured over the 52 examples +
59 saved projects + tars-pet-sg92r): ordering now routes a long wire through one
dummy per column it crosses and keeps the best of 12 sweeps by crossing count;
placement (`_align`) pulls each node to the weighted centre of its neighbours
(weight = 1/source fan-out, so a hub does not drag chains apart) and re-packs each
column in order with pool-adjacent-violators. Groups are rigid rectangles packed
first-fit (two band orders tried, shorter kept) so boxes never cut across. Totals:
crossings 1038 → 763, wire length −6.5 %, height +7 %; sg92r 75 → 49 crossings.
Uniform weights in the ORDERING step measured better (763 vs 844) — keep them.
`arrange(groups="auto")` (`?groups=auto`, `api.propose_groups`, ⌘K "Riordina +
gruppi automatici") adds `propose_groups()`: "Parametri" (every input source,
lifted into the panel — a group titled Parametri/Parameters/Params made only of
sources IS the panel), connected hubs (fan-out ≥ 3), one box per remaining chain
titled by its most downstream user name, else `<hub>[index]`. Opt-in only.

**Editor readability** ("Graph clarity" block in nodes.html): selecting nodes
dims everything outside their lineage (one even-odd veil + the lineage wires
redrawn, upstream cyan / downstream amber); nameless ListItems and chain nodes
DISPLAY a derived title (`Progetto[5] → Batteria`, `Export STL · Stampa frontale`)
via `getTitle` — never saved; a minimap in the canvas corner (click/drag to
navigate). All three toggle from ⌘K or the canvas right-click, remembered in
localStorage. `flags.collapsed` is now persisted as `collapsed: true`.

**Apply / reload rules:**
- Backend Python change → `docker restart noodle` (process caches imports;
  the read-only mount alone isn't enough).
- Frontend (`webui/*`) change → a plain reload is enough: `_revalidate_ui` in
  server.py serves /static and the pages with `Cache-Control: no-cache` (ETag →
  304). Without it a browser kept an OLD viewer.js under a NEW page and the
  module import failed — a blank editor and viewer (paid for when `poseAnim`
  moved into viewer.js). A browser that cached before that header existed
  still needs ONE hard refresh.
- Verify engine logic fast in the container (§2) before restarting.

**Gotchas:**
- The container runs as **uid 1000** (`noodle`), matching the typical host user,
  so `projects/` is host-editable. Projects created by pre-non-root images are
  root-owned — fix once with `sudo chown -R 1000:1000 projects feedback`. The
  canonical writer is still the server API (`/api/graph/{name}/...` or the UI).
- Project names are validated (`cad_nodes/store.py::validate_graph_id`): one
  path segment, `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._ -]{0,63}`. Anything else is a 400
  (path-traversal guard) — keep any new route that touches `projects/` on
  `project_dir()`/`GraphStore.dir()`.
- Running build123d prints noisy fontconfig warnings to **stderr** — redirect
  `2>/dev/null` and read stdout.
- The copilot/MCP both go through `cad_nodes.api`; new capabilities belong there
  so all three surfaces (UI, MCP, copilot) get them.

### 6e. The agent editing surface — why it exists, and its invariants

Real use, four sessions of an agent designing a robot enclosure: it never touched
MCP or the CLI. It went through `docker exec` + curl and **hand-edited graph.json
with string replace** — because the tools answered 300KB of generated code per
run, accepted any param silently, and had no way to change one line of a
CodeBlock. The editor and the agent then overwrote each other's saves. The
surface below is the answer; all of it lives in `cad_nodes/api.py`, with thin
MCP (one contiguous section of `mcp_server.py`) and HTTP twins.

- **Params are validated at the edge** (`_apply_param`): catalog name or a
  CodeBlock `#@param` (bare name → the `_cb` override), `_`-prefixed editor
  state and `selection`/`trace` pass through; everything else is an error that
  LISTS the valid names. Out-of-range numbers clamp (as the editor's typed field
  does) and say so in `notes` — except an input slider's `value`, whose catalog
  range is only the default drag window: there the `_ui` window WIDENS to fit
  (tars-pet keeps a 0-100 slider at 180). Stored graphs are never rejected —
  saves and `validate` only REPORT (`check_params`).
- **Nodes are addressed by id OR exact title** (`resolve_node`); id wins, an
  ambiguous title is an error naming the ids.
- **One implementation of every edit**: the `_op_*` functions mutate an
  in-memory Graph; the single-call functions are load → op → save, and
  `apply_ops` is load → many ops → validate → ONE save, or nothing (errors name
  the op index). Ids are never renumbered.
- **New nodes without a position are placed** (`_place_new`) with `layout`'s
  real sizes: right of their upstream after a batch, else right of the graph,
  nudged down until nothing overlaps. `arrange()` is still the real layout.
- **Lean reads**: `summarize_execute` (no code/stdout/meshes, floats to 6
  significant/4 decimals — 930KB → 6KB on a 61-node graph), `get_graph_compact`,
  `compact_catalog` (the copilot's prompt uses it too). The HTTP `/execute`
  default payload is UNCHANGED — `nodes.html` reads `data.code` for its Code
  tab — the lean shape is `?lean=1`.
- **Versions**: every write call takes an optional `base_version` (stale → 409,
  `api.StaleGraphError`) and returns the new `version` — `graph_version()` reads
  `store.version()`, the content hash of §6f.
- Tests: `tests/test_agent_api.py`, `tests/test_mcp_agent.py`,
  `tests/test_server_agent_routes.py`.

### 6f. Live sync — the editor and an agent on the same graph

graph.json has two writers: the editor's saves and an agent (API/MCP/copilot).
The incident: an agent wrote the graph while the editor was open, the editor's
next save put its older canvas back, and the agent kept telling the user "reload
before saving". Three pieces fix it:

- **Versions** (`cad_nodes/graph_version.py`): version = hash of graph.json's
  bytes (covers every writer, needs no state, cannot miss a same-size edit the
  way mtime can). `POST /api/graph/{name}` and `GraphStore.save` take an optional
  `base_version`; a stale one is refused with **409** + the current
  `{version, graph}`. No base = overwrite, as before. `GET …/version[?graph=1]`.
- **Merge** (`cad_nodes/graph_merge.py`, `POST …/merge`, stateless): three-way,
  field by field, each side diffed against ITS OWN spelling of the base (the
  editor writes every widget value, an agent may omit defaults). A true conflict
  keeps the human's value and is reported; position/collapse/size are quiet.
- **Editor** (nodes.html, "Live sync" block): every save carries its base; a
  1.5s poll of `/version` merges outside writes into the canvas — patched in
  place when only values moved, rebuilt (viewport + selection kept) otherwise;
  deferred while the human is dragging or has a modal open. Changed nodes glow
  amber, a pill shows while edits keep arriving, conflicts get a keep-mine /
  take-theirs box and hold saving until answered. Undo snapshots are rebased
  with the merge's `ops`, so Ctrl+Z never takes an agent's edit back out. A save
  of what disk already holds is skipped (every Live run saves first, and the
  echo would only bump the version under an agent).
- **Stable ids**: litegraph numbers nodes 1..N in load order and the save used
  to write those back (n51 → n49 → n48). `fromGraphJSON` now pins runtime id K
  to disk id `nK` (other ids ride on `node._gid`); `graphIdOf()` is the only way
  from a node to its id.
- Found on the way: `openGraph(currentName)` returns early for the open graph,
  so the copilot's and Import's "reload" were no-ops (then reverted by the next
  save) — they now `syncPullNow()`; and `checkDirty` re-armed the 2.5s autosave
  debounce every second, so an idle dirty graph never autosaved.
- **Verifying the editor: same project, same node, same build.** Paid for on
  `raccordo` n48 (2026-10-05): the user's tab, loaded at 23:43:45, ran the OLD
  absolute slider and saved x 127.785 → 10.0 and y 120.75 → 7.5 (a value pinned
  at the cap of a collapsed −10…10 window); the fixes landed at 23:45:59 and
  23:51:49, and the agent verified them in headless pages opened LATER, on
  copies (`zz-probe-preview`), on n23/n19 — then said "fixed" twice. Once x
  was 10 on disk, every fresh page derives −10…10 from it (the grown window
  `w._win` lives only for the session), so "I see 10" was the truth on disk.
  Three tools now close those gaps: the page carries its **build**
  (`UI_BUILD`, injected by server.py `/nodes`, = `GET /api/system/ui-build`),
  shows a reload banner when the server's moves on, and sends `ui=<build>` on
  every `/version` poll (so `docker logs noodle | grep version?ui=` says which
  build each open tab runs); `/nodes?p=<name>&readonly=1` opens the REAL project
  and can never save, draft, thumbnail or run (non-GETs refused at `fetch`,
  except the stateless `/merge` and `/anticipate`); `scripts/editor_probe.py`
  drives that page and prints, per slider, canvas value vs disk value and the
  window the canvas draws. Page loads and writes are logged as
  `client=browser|headless|curl|python …` (User-Agent), because from the host
  the user (via a LAN forward) and an agent's curl share the gateway IP;
  a headless page inside the container shows up as 127.0.0.1.

### 6g. Touch (tablets/phones) — the `── touch ──` block in nodes.html

litegraph runs on **pointer events** (`touchPreInit`, before `new LGraphCanvas`).
Everything finger-specific lives in one JS block and one CSS block named
`── touch ──`; gestures: one finger = mouse left button, two = pan + pinch-zoom,
long-press = right-click, double-tap = node search, "+ Nodo" / "Seleziona"
floating buttons. Traps worth knowing before touching canvas code:

- litegraph 0.7.18's pointer path **inverts `isPrimary`** in processMouseDown, so
  a window-capture router shows every event litegraph handles with
  `isPrimary=undefined` (= a MouseEvent). Without it double-click dies — for the
  mouse too. Non-primary fingers never reach litegraph.
- The graph canvas backing store is in **device pixels** (`TOUCH.dpr`, ≤2): the
  ratio is folded into `ds.toCanvasContext`, so `ds.scale/offset`, events and
  graph-space drawing (`onDrawForeground`) stay in CSS px. **Screen-space**
  hooks (`onDrawOverlay`, `onRenderBackground`) get an identity transform in
  device px — `ctx.scale(TOUCH.dpr, TOUCH.dpr)` first; size with the CSS rect,
  not `canvas.width` (see the `renderInfo`/`centerOnNode` overrides).
- `body.touch-ui` = the last pointer was not a mouse; it drives bigger targets
  and the single-node selection bar. Under 800px the layout is one pane at a
  time (`body[data-mtab]` = graph | view | panel).
- Use `pointerdown`, not `mousedown`, for outside-click handlers: litegraph's
  preventDefault on pointerdown suppresses the compat mouse events.

## 7. The AI copilot — scope & guardrails

`cad_nodes/copilot.py` drives an OpenAI-compatible tool loop bound to ONE graph.
Tools: `get_graph`, `get_node_def`, `add_node`, `copy_node`, `connect`,
`set_param`, `delete_node`, `execute`. It has **no tool that edits app code or
node definitions** — by construction it can only manipulate a graph.

Enforced policy (system prompt + tool layer):
- It **assembles workflows** from existing catalog nodes and **creates new custom
  nodes from scratch** (a custom node is a `CodeBlock` — arbitrary build123d code
  in its `code` param).
- It must **never** modify the app or any built-in node's behaviour.
- It may **not edit the `code` of a custom node that pre-existed the conversation**.
  `set_param` refuses an in-place code edit of such a node; the model is told to
  warn the user and use `copy_node` to work on a duplicate, leaving the original
  intact. (Nodes created in the current session are freely editable — they're
  tracked in `state["created"]`.)

If you extend the copilot, preserve these invariants.

## 7b. Retro-engineering ("retroeng") — STL/STEP → parametric graph

When the user says **"retroeng"** (e.g. *"fai il retroeng dell'STL che ti ho
passato"* / "reverse-engineer this part"), they mean the `PLAN_RETROENG.md`
workflow: rebuild an imported mesh/solid as a **parametric graph of catalog
nodes**. "The file I just passed" resolves through the **ToAgent tag index**:
in the editor the user tags an ImportSTL/ImportSTEP node with a `ToAgent` node
(label + auto-stamped save date); `GET /api/agent/tags` (= `api.agent_tags`,
MCP `cad_agent_tags`) lists every tag across ALL projects with the tagged
file's project-relative path. Pick the most recent (or label-matching) entry —
don't ask "which STL?".

The loop (validated on real parts: STEP rebuilt at Δvolume 0.05%, a 59k-tri
STL at +2.2% — see `projects/retro_nodes` and `projects/retromy`):

1. **Perceive** — `GET /api/graph/{name}/slice_summary?path=<file>&n=10`
   (`api.slice_summary`): symbolic cross-sections on all 3 axes (`circle r=3
   @(x,y)`, `rect 40x30`; dedup "z=a…b identical" ⇒ extrusion + its height).
   STEP sections are exact; STL is arc-fitted. The `text` field is the
   LLM-facing format. Omit `path` to slice the graph's OWN result.
2. **Microscope** where the summary is ambiguous —
   `.../section_outline?axis=z&pos=…`: ONE exact section, edge by edge.
   Mesh gotcha: a single section can drop loops near tangent surfaces —
   confirm with nearby sections or with per-section areas.
3. **Rebuild** with catalog nodes via `cad_nodes.api` — one `apply_ops`
   batch (§6e). Proceduralize, don't trace: constant section → Extrude; N equal
   circles in a regular layout → ArrayLinear/ArrayPolar with a count slider,
   not copies; small rounds → a downstream Fillet; overall dims → sliders.
   The user's stated intent about what to parameterize wins over defaults.
4. **Verify with the same tool** — execute, re-slice your own result
   (`slice_summary` without `path`) and diff the two summaries as text;
   comparing per-section AREAS localizes residuals; bbox + volume checksum
   is the final seal.

The agent-facing version of this loop is AGENT_HELP topic `retroeng`.

Not yet built (see PLAN_RETROENG.md): vision contact-sheet, gcode stripper,
numeric `cad_compare`.

## 8. Tests

`tests/` are pure-Python (no build123d needed): toposort, graph validation,
transpiler output, api ops.

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v        # pytest may need installing in your env
```

## 9. The agent's eyes — `/api/graph/{name}/screenshot`

`GET /api/graph/{name}/screenshot` → `image/png` (= `cad_screenshot` on MCP,
`api.screenshot`, code in `cad_nodes/screenshot.py`). Args: `view`
(`iso|front|back|left|right|top|bottom`) or `azim`+`elev`, `zoom`, `node`+
`isolate` (frame one node), `width`/`height`/`scale`, `projection`,
`chrome`, `run`. Headers: `X-Noodle-Ran`, `X-Noodle-Size-Mm`.

**Why it exists, concretely.** The Thread node (§5g) shipped with volume
1922mm³, a watertight mesh, an exact major diameter and 237 green tests — and
no thread on the bolt at all: the example wired a shank as fat as the nominal
diameter, so the union filled every groove. Nothing in the API could report
that. The first rendered picture did, immediately. **Numbers verify what you
thought to measure; a picture shows what you did not.**

- **It is the REAL viewer, not a second renderer.** Headless Chromium over this
  server's own `/nodes` page: same `viewer.js`, materials, finishes, selective
  bloom, same camera code. A numpy rasterizer was considered and rejected — it
  would be free to drift from the thing users actually look at, and blind to
  precisely the work that went into glass/emissive/rainbow/bloom.
- **No GPU needed**: SwiftShader, verified pixel-identical to hardware GL. A GPU
  is opt-in: `NOODLE_BROWSER_GPU=vulkan|gl` + the `docker-compose.gpu.yml`
  overlay (CDI device AND the Vulkan/EGL manifests — the device alone silently
  stays on SwiftShader). On podman: `podman-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f
  docker-compose.gpu.yml --podman-run-args="--userns=keep-id:uid=1000,gid=1000"
  up -d --force-recreate`.
- **The browser is kept WARM**, like the execution worker: ~5-10s cold, **~0.7s**
  warm with `run=0`. Take extra angles freely; re-run only when geometry changed.
- **…and the page is FROZEN between shots** (`_freeze`: a CDP debugger pause).
  It is the real editor, whose animate loop redraws 60×/s forever; left warm
  and running after one shot it held ~11 cores on SwiftShader for ten hours.
  `Page.setWebLifecycleState frozen` does NOT work (headless pages are always
  visible, and Chromium only freezes hidden ones — it answers OK anyway). A
  FAILED shot closes the page instead of parking it: a half-booted page used to
  fail every later shot until a restart.
- **The warm page must not show you the PREVIOUS graph.** It only re-navigated
  when the URL changed, so shooting the same project twice reused whatever was on
  screen — edit a graph, shoot it with `run=0`, and you were handed the geometry
  from before the edit, silently. That is the exact failure this endpoint exists
  to prevent, and it cost three rounds of "why is the picture identical" before it
  was found. `graph.json`'s mtime now decides: unchanged → reuse the page (the
  fast multi-angle path is intact), changed → re-read AND re-run. Note it re-reads
  with `window.openGraph(name)` rather than a reload: the editor guards
  `beforeunload` while the doc is dirty, and a navigation stalls on that until the
  element screenshot times out. A run is unavoidable on change — opening a project
  does not restore previews from view.json (§9b), only running draws.
- **The shot page is a READER — taking a picture must never destroy the subject.**
  It loads the real editor, and `runGraph()` began with `await saveGraph()` like
  any user, so a shot whose warm page held a STALE in-memory graph wrote that
  stale copy straight over `graph.json`. Measured, the hard way: three rounds of
  careful graph edits were reverted to a pre-fix version by the act of
  screenshotting them, with the save logged from `127.0.0.1` (the headless
  browser), not from the user. `runGraph` now skips the save when
  `window.__noodleShot` is set — and that is also *more* correct, since /execute
  runs the graph ON DISK, which is exactly what an agent wants rendered. The flag
  already existed for the thumbnail (§9b); it now guards the write too.
- **A heavy glass scene can be too slow to shoot at all.** `transmission` makes
  three.js re-render the whole scene per transparent body; on SwiftShader (no GPU)
  a pile of six glass bodies never finishes a frame and `Locator.screenshot` times
  out with a misleading "element not stable". `hq=0` completes. If a scene must be
  shot at HQ, give only the things that need it a glass finish — which per-body
  finishes (§5d-bis) now make possible.
- **NOT through `off_loop()`** (unlike every other engine route) and deliberately: the work
  happens in the browser process, so the coroutine only awaits I/O. The graph run
  it triggers goes through /execute, which is already off the loop.
- **Two traps paid for.** `openGraph` is async, so calling `runGraph()` too early
  executes an EMPTY graph and the wait for previews then times out with nothing
  to explain it — wait for `lgraph._nodes.length > 0` first. And the first `iso`
  preset used a POSITIVE azimuth, which puts the camera behind anything modelled
  facing front: every default shot came back with its lettering mirrored. It is
  now front-right-top (-45°, true isometric 35.264°). Both were found by looking.
- **Deployment**: `playwright install --with-deps` resolves an UBUNTU package set
  and dies on Debian (`ttf-ubuntu-font-family has no installation candidate`),
  taking the browser with it — the Dockerfile lists the libs by hand, and
  `fonts-liberation` is the one that matters (without a font, every label in the
  viewport renders as a blank box). Browsers go to `/opt/playwright`, world-
  readable, because the server runs as uid 1000 and cannot read root's HOME.
  Only the **headless shell** is installed: `playwright install chromium` fetches
  the full browser too (549MB) and noodle never opens a window — the shell does
  WebGL2 through SwiftShader (ANGLE/Vulkan), verified. Measured cost of the whole
  feature: **1.87GB -> 2.6GB** (+730MB); installing both browsers made it 3.35GB.
  A missing browser is a **503**, not a 500.
- **`node` may name ANY geometry node**, not only a drawn one: `api.screenshot`
  resolves it by id or title and, when its eye is not on, turns it on in
  graph.json for the shot and restores it in a `finally` (the shot page reads
  the graph from disk, so there is no in-memory way). A node with nothing
  drawable (a slider) is a 400 before any browser work.
- **The shot page shows the viewport ALONE** (`screenshot._SHOT_LAYOUT`, an init
  script): the page is the real editor, laid out for a human. At width ≤ 800 it
  took the phone layout — graph pane only — so the canvas was hidden and every
  narrow shot waited 30s for "element is not visible" and came back 502 (blamed
  at first on `node`/`isolate`, which were innocent); at desktop widths the
  viewport was the right half under a toolbar, so 900×600 came back as ~472×307
  CSS px. Now `width`×`height` IS the picture, at any width. Hidden layout must
  not be a grid row: with toolbar/statusbar `display:none` the workspace lands
  in the toolbar's grid row and gets its height — hence `display:block` + `100vh`.
- **A failed capture is never a 200.** `api._check_png` rejects anything that
  is not a PNG or is under 200 bytes (`ScreenshotFailed`), and the route maps
  every non-HTTP failure to a **502** with the reason — an agent doing
  `curl -o shot.png` used to save an error body as its "picture".
- Agent-facing usage: AGENT_HELP topic `screenshots`.
- Tests: `tests/test_screenshot.py` (pure-Python: camera planning, the clamps,
  and that HTTP/MCP expose one operation rather than two).

## 9b. Workflow thumbnails — the picture the library lists you by

A name does not say what a part is. `projects/<name>/thumb.jpg` does, and it shows
up in the `/` gallery cards and the editor's project dropdown (placeholder `⬡`
when absent). Roadmap item 2 of `PLAN_NODE_CAD.md`.

- **It is NOT taken with §9.** The agent's eyes drive a *second, headless* browser
  that re-executes the graph to redraw a frame the user is already looking at.
  The thumbnail is instead read straight off the editor's own canvas
  (`CadViewer.snapshot()` → `PUT /api/projects/{name}/thumb`): one extra render of
  a scene drawn 60×/s anyway, no execution, and it is literally what the user sees
  — glass, bloom, rainbow and camera angle included. The server only stores bytes.
- **The read-back must be in the same task as the render.** Without
  `preserveDrawingBuffer` the WebGL buffer is cleared once the browser composites,
  so an `await` between `_renderFrame()` and `toDataURL()` comes back blank.
  `_renderFrame()` is shared with the animate loop for the same reason a second
  renderer was rejected in §9: a copy of the bloom sequence would drift.
- **The gate is not "Live mode", it is `lastRunJSON === lastSavedJSON`** — the
  geometry on screen was computed from the graph now on disk. In Live that is true
  the instant the run lands, so it is free and invisible; outside Live, Run-then-Save
  satisfies it too, and a bare save shoots nothing rather than storing a lie.
  Opening another graph clears `lastRunJSON` (the viewport still shows the one you
  left). Empty viewport → no upload, so the last good picture survives.
- **The agent's headless page is not a user.** It loads this same editor and *does*
  save (runGraph saves first), so `screenshot.py` stamps `window.__noodleShot` in an
  init script and `maybeThumb()` bails. Without it every agent screenshot would
  silently overwrite the user's thumbnail with the agent's camera angle.
- Grid, origin axes and the nav gizmo are hidden for the shot and restored in a
  `finally` — a 200px card wants the part, and yanking the user's camera on every
  save would be worse than having no thumbnail. ~10-20KB per JPEG, long side 480.
- Secondary and maybe the biggest win: **the thumbnail is a proof of execution**.
  A workflow that cannot produce one is broken, and you see it from the gallery
  without opening it.
- Tests: `tests/test_thumbnail.py`.

## 9c. Generations + the read-only viewer — a link instead of a screenshot

`/view/<graph>/<gen>` (`webui/view.html`) is a read-only 3D viewer for a
**generation**: a frozen copy of one run — `view.json` + the `graph.json` that
made it + a meta (label, date, graph version, content hash, piece names) — under
`projects/<graph>/gens/g<N>/`. An agent sends the user that link instead of
screenshots: the user orbits the real scene, and the link keeps showing THAT
result while the workflow moves on.

- **Made by** `api.snapshot` = `POST /api/graph/{name}/snapshot?label=&run=` =
  MCP `cad_snapshot` (returns `{gen, url, pieces, reused}`); listed by
  `GET .../gens` / `cad_list_gens`; files at `GET .../gens/{gen}/{view|graph|meta}`
  (immutable, cached a year). `run=1` (default) executes first, so the gen is the
  graph as SAVED, not whatever last ran — through `off_loop()`. A result identical
  to the newest gen (same previews hash, same label) is returned with
  `reused: true` instead of piling up duplicates. Numbers are never reused
  (`mkdir` claims them), so a link means one thing forever. The absolute URL uses
  `NOODLE_PUBLIC_URL` if set, else the request's base (HTTP) / localhost (MCP).
- **The page reads only the frozen copy** — never `/api/graph/{name}/view`, which is
  live — and writes nothing. It renders through the shared `CadViewer`, with
  colour/finish/wireframe taken from the FROZEN graph. A badge says when the live
  workflow has changed since (graph version differs). `/view/<graph>` opens the
  newest gen and rewrites the URL to the fixed `/gN` one.
- **Pieces**: one row per drawn node; a node whose preview holds several pieces
  expands — fanned-out lists (`parts` → the one merged buffer is split into
  geometry groups with a material each, and a hidden part is
  `material.visible=false`) and collide scenes (`bodies` → the Group's children).
  Visibility lives at LEAF level, which is what makes **Inverti** well defined.
  Click/dblclick (solo) in the list, click in 3D to select, H hide, Alt+click hide,
  I invert, A all, F frame visible (measured on visible leaves only — `Box3.
  setFromObject` counts hidden children, hence `CadViewer.frame(box)`).
- **State in the hash**: `#hide=n3,n7.2` (a bare node id = all its pieces), kept in
  sync as the user clicks — so an agent can send a link already set up (lid
  hidden), and "Copia link" hands back exactly what the user is looking at.
- **Touch / narrow screens**: under 760px the header folds into a `⋯` menu (info,
  share via `navigator.share` → copy, ortho, editor) and the pieces become a bottom
  sheet — tap the handle to collapse, drag it to resize; a ResizeObserver keeps the
  canvas out from under it. On `pointer:coarse` rows are 44px, every row carries an
  explicit ● (toggle) and ◎ (solo) button, and a tap toggles at once: a finger has no
  double-click, so the 220ms wait that tells a mouse click from a dblclick would only
  be lag. A tap in 3D selects and opens a floating bar (Nascondi / Solo / ✕) — the
  touch twin of `H`. Tap vs orbit: 12px / 500ms tolerance for a finger, 5px for a
  mouse, never during a pinch; double tap = frame the visible pieces.
- Tests: `tests/test_generations.py`.
- **`/views` — every proposal in one place** (`webui/gens.html`, `api.recent_gens`,
  `GET /api/gens/recent?limit=&project=`, MCP `cad_recent_gens`). Paid for in
  friction: an agent asked for several alternatives sent one link per design, and
  "the second one" / "the round one" never meant the same thing to both sides.
  Every gen of every project is a card, newest first, grouped by day, and each
  goes by ONE name — its **ref** `<graph>/g<N>` — on the card, in the `/view`
  header chip (click = copy `ref (label)`) and in `cad_snapshot`'s result. `/view`
  also gets ‹ › (`[` `]`) through the project's gens and a link to the gallery
  (also in the editor toolbar ◫, home and library).
  Two files sit BESIDE a gen without touching its immutable view/graph/meta:
  `seen.json` (`/view` POSTs `…/gens/{gen}/seen` on open → `last_seen: true` in the
  listing = what the user means by "this one"; kept even past `limit`) and
  `thumb.jpg`, **write-once**, drawn by the first page that renders the gen with
  the SHARED CadViewer — `/views` draws the missing ones on an off-screen canvas,
  `/view` takes one before the link's hidden pieces apply. The thumb GET route is
  declared before the generic `gens/{gen}/{part}` one, or `{part}` swallows it.
  `scripts/build_pages.py` maps the listing to the static `gens.json` (flagged
  `thumb: true` so a static page never tries to upload) and points ◫ at `../`.
- **Timelines play.** A generation of a graph with `Animate` / `Drop` nodes carries
  their plans (`previews[id].anim`, a scene's `bodies[i].anim`), and `/view` shows a
  ▶ player — so a movement (lid open ⇄ closed) is ONE link, not one per pose. One
  clock drives every plan through `poseAnim()`, the SAME function the editor's live
  scrub uses: `dropMatrixAt` / `keyInterp` / `sceneBodyPose` / `poseAnim` moved from
  nodes.html into viewer.js for exactly that reason (two copies would drift).
  `t` is each plan's own normalised 0..1, one pass lasts the longest plan's `T`,
  with a 0.6s pause at the ends. Mode defaults to `pingpong` when every plan is an
  Animate (kinematics) and `loop` as soon as a Drop is involved (a fall played
  backwards is nonsense). Hash: `t=`, `play=1`, `mode=`; they are read ONCE at load
  (`HASH0`) because the first `writeHash()` runs before the timeline exists and
  used to eat `play=1`. "Inquadra" frames the union over the whole movement
  (sampled), so an opening lid never swings out of the frame. The clock follows
  wall time (dt capped at 0.5s): a slow device skips frames rather than slowing the
  motion — the glass jar runs at ~1.7fps on SwiftShader, fine on a real GPU.
  `api.snapshot` reports `timeline: {seconds}` and marks `animated` pieces.
- **One track per movement (≡ Tracce).** Every animated node is also a TRACK
  with its own `t`, slider and ▶ (played alone, over its own `T`); the master
  slider still moves them all. Why: choreographing a sequence on one clock
  (`delay` + `hold` arithmetic) is what an agent got wrong on `walle` — it chained
  Animate(open) → Animate(close), which does NOT sequence: the downstream one
  moves its input frozen at the upstream's `t`, and only the last plan replays,
  so the lid stayed shut and the head folded through it. Now the agent makes one
  Animate per moving part and the USER plays the order; `lint.py` flags the chain
  (`animate_chain`). Hash: `tt=<id>:<t>,…` (only tracks that differ from the
  master `t`), `tracks=1` (panel open). Framing restores every track's own `t`.
  Example project: `projects/cassone-demo` (a chest whose lid opens on a hinge).
- **✎ Disegna — the user draws FOR the agent.** In /view (button, or `D`) the
  user paints on the part — circles a hole in red, marks a fillet, writes ON
  it — picks colour/size; it is stored AS THEY DRAW as a NOTE beside
  the gen (`gens/gN/notes/aK.{json,jpg}` — the gen's own files stay immutable;
  `aK.claim` is kept so an id is never reused, like a gen number). Strokes are
  paint ON THE SURFACE, not on the screen: each pointer sample is a raycast
  (`firstHit`) kept with its face normal, drawn as a tube lifted along it, so a
  mark means a PLACE in model mm and stays put while the view orbits. Width is
  picked in px and turned into mm where the stroke starts. Routing: a press ON
  the part paints and is stopped at `#vp` in the CAPTURE phase, before
  OrbitControls; background / right button / wheel still move the view; a
  second finger cancels the stroke and RE-DISPATCHES the first finger's
  pointerdown to the canvas, or OrbitControls would see a lone finger and
  rotate instead of pinching. The JPEG is the user's own view (`snapshot({frame:
  false})`). The pen lifts wherever it leaves the surface (over the hole it
  circles), so the server also summarises per GESTURE (`marks`): `shape` loop/
  line/dot — loop = sweeps ≥270° round its centre, because a circle round a hole
  arrives as an open C — `centre`/`bbox` and `on` = node(s) of the gen's frozen
  graph. Agent side: `cad_notes` / `GET /api/notes`, `cad_note_image`,
  `cad_note_done` (reply shown under the note); `recent_gens` counts open
  `notes`; `#note=aK` opens the viewer on one. Tests: `tests/test_notes.py`.
  - **The bar is four tabs + one common row** (`PLAN_VIEW_TOOLS.md` §1):
    ✎ Matita (✎ penna — flat —, ✎³ penna 3D, T vernice, ▭ decal) · ◆ Tag (⚑
    targhetta, 🖼 Img) · ▣ Blocky (▣ forma + its kind, the gizmo modes ✥ ⟳ ▣
    ◌) · 🔧 Tool (↔ metro + modes, ✂ sezione — a disabled placeholder until
    task A). Keys `1-4`; P/T/E/M/F as before, a key shared by several tools
    (P, T) takes the one used last; tab + tool per tab remembered in
    localStorage `noodle:view:drawTools`. Common row, every tab: ↶ ↷ 🗑 ⌫ Muovi,
    colours, sizes. The TAB row ends with the note's name + state (`#d-save`:
    ● g4#a1, green saved / ◌ saving / ⚠ not saved — click copies the ref),
    Fatto ✓ · ⋯ (Pulisci, on every screen — and 🗑 next to ↷ is the same
    Pulisci in sight, since nobody found it in the menu) · ▾ · ✕. On a phone that end
    sits on its own line above the tabs, the tool row scrolls sideways, the
    common row stays; on `pointer:coarse` those buttons are ≥ 44px.
    **▾ hides the bar while you work** (quill: «nascondere la tab disegna
    mentre si fa un'operazione»; key **B** — H already hides a piece): only
    the top row is left (`#vp.dhide`: the tool in hand as a chip that
    reopens it, the name, Fatto ⋯ ▴ ✕), at the top on a desktop and at the
    bottom on a phone, where the bar was. The tool is NOT deselected — you
    keep drawing, placing/scaling shapes (their own `#s-bar` stays), measuring;
    the ✂ cut's controls live in the tool row, so with the bar hidden its own
    `#cutbar` comes back. Not remembered: entering ✎ always opens it whole. There is **no note text field** any more: a note is what is
    drawn and written on the part; `text` stays in the data ('' for new notes,
    an old note's sentence is kept when it is resumed).
    **A tool is one `registerTool({id, tab, key, icon, label, title, mode,
    cursor, hint, options, select, deselect, down/move/up/cancel, click,
    ownsTaps, disabled})`** — `webui/view-tools.js`, a table + a dispatcher
    that calls the active tool's handlers in the CAPTURE phase on `#vp` (a
    gesture stays with the tool that got its pointerdown); `ctx` carries
    what view.html shares with a tool module. Tests:
    `tests/ui/view-tools.test.cjs`.
  - **↷ redo**: the action stack has two sides (`actions` / `redone`); ↶
    steps back, ↷ steps forward, a new action (`pushAction`) empties the redo
    side; Ctrl+Shift+Z / Ctrl+Y. Every step goes through the autosave (PUT;
    DELETE when nothing is left — a ↷ after that is a new note, new id) and
    re-shoots the view pictures it touched (`refreshViews`), both ways. A
    module's action may carry its own `undo()` / `redo()`.
  - **One picture per VIEW, not per note** — paid for on the first real note:
    the main JPEG is the LAST view, and a cross drawn under a bolt head from
    below was simply not in it (nor a line along the thread); the agent found
    them only in the coordinates. Now the pen-up shoots the current view
    (`takeView`), re-shooting instead of adding when the camera has not moved;
    views equal to the final one are dropped at send. Files `aK.vN.jpg`, a
    mark carries `view` (0 = main) + its own `image_path`, `cad_note_image(…,
    mark=N)`.
  - **↶ takes back ACTIONS and never leaves a lying photo.** The undo stack
    holds actions (pen gesture, ⌫ erase drag, T label, label edit), so undoing
    an erase puts the strokes back in their original order (`k`). Paid for on
    `prova-disegno/g1#a1`: ↶ took «xBIG» off the model but not off the photo
    of its view, and an agent read the leftover «x» on a hole as "remove it".
    Now every view that lost (or regained) something is re-shot FROM ITS OWN
    camera (`refreshViews` → `shootFrom`: camera swapped in and out inside one
    task, `_renderFrame` before the browser composites); a view left empty
    keeps its camera with `image: null` and is not sent; only a persp↔ortho
    change falls back to a fresh picture of the current view.
  - **✎ as a 3D pen — ink piles up where you INSIST** (`webui/pen3d.js`,
    pure, `tests/ui/pen3d.test.cjs`). quill: «penna 3D immaginaria con cui
    fare cacchette… solo se si insiste a girare su un punto, senza torri
    fuori controllo». Each pen sample gets a `lift` (mm along its normal) on
    top of the 0.6 r the tube always has: the ink under the pen is measured
    as the LENGTH of earlier stroke inside its reach, in passes (one straight
    pass = 2 × reach) — counting runs of samples read a circle's seam, where
    it starts AND ends, as two passes. Under 1.5 passes → 0 (a line crossed
    once or twice stays flat); from there one layer (0.7 × width) on top of
    the highest ink under the pen, so each further loop adds ONE layer; along
    the stroke the lift moves ≤ 1 mm per mm (a ramp, never a wall — off a
    heap it hangs a moment, like a real 3D pen). The pen's own last 2.5
    widths are its wake, not old ink. Painted text never stacks. Measured in
    the browser: 1 and 2 loops flat, 8 loops ≈ 2.5 mm. The note carries
    `lifts` per stroke (only when > 0) and `height_mm` per stroke and per mark
    — read by the agent as «material here, this tall».
  - **The note saves itself — there is no send button.** Paid for on
    `creepyfinger-v4/g13` (feedback 20261008-153010): quill drew for a quarter
    of an hour, the page was reloaded, and it was gone — the server log showed
    not one write in between, because a note reached the server only when
    "Invia all'agente" was pressed. Now every change goes through `syncDraw()`,
    which schedules `flushSave()` (900ms debounce, one request in flight): the
    first change POSTs and gets the id, every later one PUTs the WHOLE note
    back under that id (`PUT …/notes/{id}` → `api.add_note(note_id=)` →
    `store.save_gen_note`, which keeps `created`, sets `updated`, deletes the
    pictures the rewrite no longer names and REOPENS a note the agent had
    closed, its reply kept in `reopened`). **The undo history rides along**
    (quill: «salva la history nel file così si può annullare anche se
    ricarico»): `historyOut()` names items by their `k` (unique, ++seq) —
    `live` = the k of each item of the note in its own order, `pool` = every
    item an action still points at that is off the part, in full, plus
    `actions`/`redone` by k — and the server keeps it as `aK.history.json`
    beside the note (never in the note, never shown to the agent); `resumeNote`
    reads it back (`historyIn`), so ↶ ↷ survive a reload. 🗑 Pulisci
    (`clearAll`, also visible next to ↷) is an erase of everything, so ↶ undoes
    it and it no longer asks. A note with nothing on it but something to bring
    back is KEPT with `empty: true` — hidden from `list_notes`, the open-note
    counts and the /view list, resumed by its page; with no history either, or
    on «Fatto», it is DELETEd. It compares a signature of the content, computed with
    every view at its own index — tied to the camera, orbiting after a stroke
    re-saved the note. A failed save shows `⚠ non salvata, riprovo` in the
    `#d-save` chip and retries every 4s; `visibilitychange` (a phone
    backgrounding the page) saves at once, `beforeunload` with a change still
    unsent saves AND asks. «Fatto ✓» closes the note:
    the next mark starts a new one. The live note is drawn by the draft, not
    by `noteObject` (it would show twice), and is «✎ in corso» in the list.
    **…and it comes BACK into the draft** (`resumeNote`): strokes (painted
    letters re-linked to their words), labels, placed pictures (fetched and
    turned back into data URLs, since every PUT re-sends them), measures,
    shapes (`rot` = surfQuat(normal)⁻¹ · quat, `ffd` kept) and the view
    pictures, with `save.id` on the note — so it stays ONE note across a
    reload. The page remembers the note it was drawing per gen in
    localStorage (`noodle:view:live:<graph>/<gen>`, a convenience: the server
    holds the note) and resumes it on load unless it is done; any note has a
    ✎ in the list to continue it. The undo history is not rebuilt: ↶ starts
    from the note as saved (⌫ still rubs anything out).
  - **The brush: alpha + width, for ✎ and ✎³ alike** (common row). Three
    ALPHAS (`webui/ink.js`): *sfumato* `soft` (the spray that evens out; ✎³ a
    tapered, matte bead), *normale* `normal` (a marker's crisp edge; ✎³ the
    round tube), *stellina* `star` (stars stamped along the stroke at a fixed
    pace — `stamp` = arc length so far, each star drawn by the segment its
    centre falls in; ✎³ the tube through a star nozzle). Width = a slider
    1…80 px on a square law. Both remembered (`noodle:view:penAlpha|penSize`).
    Each stroke saves `pen` (spray|3d) and `alpha`, so a reloaded ✎³ line stays
    filament even when it never piled up; absent = what the pen drew before
    alphas (soft spray, round tube). 🖼 Two picture squares: one among the
    tips (a photo as the ALPHA — stamped on ✎, a relief on ✎³) and one among
    the colours (a photo as the colour TEXTURE — along the stroke, per stamp,
    wrapped round the tube). `webui/brush-img.js` prepares any photo with no
    question asked: ground read on a ring 4–8% inside the border (the outer
    band is often a frame — taken for the ground it turned a leaf inside out),
    crop to the subject, polarity, levels with a floor over the ground's
    grain, round feather; the texture is cropped by covering and sampled
    mirrored (no seam). The pictures travel INSIDE the note as small JPEG
    data URLs (`brushes`, strokes name them by `brush`/`tex` index; the agent's
    listing leaves them out). The toast steps past every visible bar
    (`placeToast`): it used to cover the folded ✎ row and the shape's bar.
  - **⌫ eraser**: any object of the note, whole — a stroke (the pen already
    splits them where it leaves the surface), a painted word, a targhetta, a
    decal, a picture, a dimension (along its line), a shape — hit-tested in 3D — the point on the PART vs each stroke's
    polyline, radius from the size buttons in px → mm (`ERASE_PX`). Picking
    the tubes would miss 3px lines and catch strokes on the far side. Draft
    only; sent notes stay immutable.
  - **T — text ON the part, and it is DATA.** Drag a box (a tap = default box,
    smaller on a phone), type, Enter; tap a label with T to edit; ⌫ rubs it
    out. Three STYLES = three tools (T vernice and ▭ decal in ✎ Matita, ⚑
    targhetta in ◆ Tag), the last one remembered (`noodle:view:labelStyle`),
    stored per label as `style` ("tag" when absent, for old notes):
    **✎ vernice** (`paint`, the default) — quill: «come disegna già a mano può
    stampare testo?». The words are laid out in the box in SCREEN space with a
    single-stroke font (Hershey Roman Simplex, public domain, embedded as
    `HERSHEY`; à è é ì ò ù = base + a drawn accent), every glyph polyline is
    sampled every ~2.5 px and each sample goes through the pen's `surfaceHit`.
    Out come ordinary pen strokes (broken off the surface and on depth jumps,
    width from the size button capped at a sixth of the letter height), so the
    text lies on a plane, a cylinder, a thread, anything, with no special case
    and no new rendering. The strokes carry `label`: one gesture for ↶ and ⌫, a
    tap with T re-letters it, and the server marks them `kind: "text"` and keeps
    them OUT of `marks` (forty «line» marks for one word buried the real
    circle). Why the decal stopped being the default: it doubled on ridges by
    parallax and needed a special case per surface (plane, cylinder, sphere…).
    **⚑ targhetta** — anchor dot + stem
    along the normal + a `THREE.Sprite` plate that always faces the camera,
    every piece drawn twice (depth-tested full, and `depthTest:false` at 0.35
    on top) so it reads from behind and shows through the part faded. Asked by
    quill: a decal vanishes as soon as you orbit behind. **▭ decal** — three's
    vendored `DecalGeometry` from a `CanvasTexture`; normal = mean of a
    5×5 raycast grid under the box, up = camera up projected on the plane,
    size = the box's corners met with that plane (`planeSize` — px×mmPerPx
    ignored foreshortening and halved labels on a slanted top face). Back
    faces are dropped (`frontFaces`) and coverage < 50% → a targhetta. RIDGED
    surfaces get the targhetta too (`probeUnder`: |Σn|/n < 0.9 — a thread is
    ~0.87, 90° of cylinder 0.90): a decal projects along the normal, and on the
    bolt of `zz-note-probe` «filetto M8?» came out doubled by parallax. The old
    fallback, a one-sided flat card lifted to the highest crest, is gone: on a
    box straddling the bolt head it floated 3.4 mm off the part — the «faccia
    volante» quill saw. **Regular surfaces are not projected** (quill: «sulle
    curve proiettala o usa uv per superfici regolari»): `fitSurface` samples a
    7×7 raycast grid and tries plane (normals within 4°) → cylinder (axis =
    smallest eigenvector of Σnnᵀ, after RANSAC over normal pairs — 2 samples of
    49 on a cross-hole ledge had turned the nut's side into a «sphere»; radius
    by a Kåsa fit on the POINTS, since the viewport's flat facets make normal-
    based radii wrong by half a facet) → sphere (only if the normals turn round
    two axes: a thin cylinder band fits a sphere just as well). A fit with low
    residual gets its own grid patch with UVs (`patchGeometry`): on a cylinder
    an isometry, box width = arc length, ≤150° of arc; sphere by the
    exponential map. Stored as `surface` (plane|cylinder|sphere|decal|tag) +
    `fit`, so a saved note is redrawn without refitting. The note carries `labels: [{text, style, surface, fit, at,
    normal, up, size_mm, color, node, view}]`; `_link_labels` adds
    `near_marks` (within 1.5 label sizes, else the nearest within 2) and lists
    the texts under each mark's `labels` — recomputed on read like `marks`.
    A note of labels alone is valid. `near_marks`' fallback (the nearest mark
    when none is within 1.5 sizes) reaches 2 label sizes, no further.
  - **Img — a picture placed on the part.** «Img» picks a PNG/JPEG (on a phone
    the camera too: `accept="image/*"`), shrunk in the browser to a long side
    of 1600 px; drag a box and it lands in proportion — on the SURFACE, not on
    screen (`L.h = L.w / aspect`: a 2:1 picture came out 1.2:1 on the slanted
    top of the nut) — through the ▭ decal path (fitted patch, DecalGeometry,
    targhetta). Stored as `aK.img<N>.png|jpg` beside the note (PNG/JPEG by
    magic bytes, ≤ 4 MB each, ≤ 8; body limit 40 MB), described in `images`
    like a label; `GET …/notes/{id}/img/{k}`; `cad_notes` gives each its
    `image_path`/`image_url`. ↶ and ⌫ as a label; replacing = rub out + place.
  - **The other way round: the agent TAGS the pieces it shows.**
    `api.tag_gen` / `POST …/gens/{gen}/tags` / MCP `cad_tag_gen` (or `tags=` on
    `cad_snapshot`, one call; a bad tag there is `tags_error`, not a failed
    snapshot) write `gens/gN/tags.json` beside the gen — `[{text, node, at?,
    color?}]`, `node` resolved against the gen's frozen `pieces` (id or exact
    title; unknown/ambiguous → an error listing them). /view draws them as
    targhette — anchor dot + stem + a `THREE.Sprite` plate facing the camera,
    each piece drawn twice (depth-tested, and `depthTest:false` at 0.35) so a
    tag reads from behind and shows through the part faded — in the agent's
    look (cyan rim, a drawn ◆). Without `at` the anchor is the piece's topmost
    point nearest the opening camera (a ray at the bbox centre dives into the
    hole of a nut). «◆ Tag» hides them all (`#tags=0`), a hidden piece hides
    its tags, a tap selects the piece, the piece row carries a ◆N badge.
  - **Opening a note fits it to THIS screen** (`goToNote`): the camera carries
    `aspect` (and ortho `zoom`); on a narrower screen it backs off by the ratio,
    then until every stroke projects inside. `cam.lookAt` inside that loop is
    load-bearing — the controls orient the camera only on `update()`, and
    without it every stroke tested off-screen and the part shrank to a dot.
- **↔ Metro — dimensions ON the part, both ways** (`PLAN_VIEW_MEASURE.md`).
  `measureObject` in view.html is the third kind of targhetta: two anchors, a
  line with arrowheads (outside, pointing in, when there is no room), extension
  lines when `n`+`off` lift it, a ring for Ø/R, the plate BESIDE the line on
  screen (re-decided each frame in `onBeforeRender`), every piece twice like
  `tagObject` (depth-tested + 0.35 ghost). mm, 2 decimals, decimal comma; `≈`
  when the value came from a tessellated curve. Violet = the user's, cyan ◆ =
  the agent's, or green/amber/red by `status`. «↔ Quote» / `#measures=0`.
  - **The user's** (✎ Disegna → ↔, `M`): a TAP takes a point — the tool never
    captures the pointer, so a drag still orbits; with a mouse a rubber
    dimension follows; Shift locks to the dominant axis; Esc drops the first
    point; Enter / the same feature twice = its Ø or length. Modes (remembered,
    `noodle:view:measureMode`): Auto, Punto–punto, Spigolo, Foro / cerchio,
    Faccia–faccia. Part of the draft like a stroke (↶, ⌫ along its line, view
    pictures); sent as the note's `measures` (`api._measures`), read by the
    agent through `cad_notes` with a one-line `summary` and `near_marks` (a Ø
    reaches 1.5·r: the pen circles the RIM, the Ø sits at the centre). On a
    phone, press and HOLD: a lens above the finger, lifting takes the point.
  - **Snaps without a B-Rep** — `webui/measure.js`, pure, tested in node
    (`tests/ui/measure.test.cjs`): weld → sharp edges (>28°) → chains between
    corners classified line / circle / arc / curve (PCA plane + Kåsa +
    Gauss–Newton), planar faces by flood fill (same normal AND same plane),
    cylinders from a smooth patch's normals, a spatial grid. Built lazily per
    piece (~170 ms on the 19k-tri nut). Priority: vertex > circle centre >
    edge > face > free. A thread is the trap: thousands of crests, each a
    "vertex" — a spot with >10 sharp edges within 2·rE snaps circles only, a
    piece over 20k sharp edges snaps faces only. Two EDGES are measured
    lato–lato — at their closest points (`polylineGap`, segment–segment), in
    Auto and in the Spigolo–spigolo mode; `exact` does the same on the B-Rep.
    A silhouette edge is where a ray GRAZES past the part, so a miss looks
    around within the snap radius and accepts only an edge/vertex/circle
    there (never a free point in the air). Two traps paid for: a point
    lying ON the tapped plane measured 0 (now: the distance to the tapped
    spot), and `e.at || e` on an end given as `[x,y,z]` — an Array HAS `.at`
    (Array.prototype.at), so every agent dimension vanished silently.
  - **The agent's**: `api.measure_gen` / `POST|GET …/gens/{gen}/measures` /
    MCP `cad_measure_gen` / `measures=` on `cad_snapshot`, stored in
    `gens/gN/measures.json` (beside tags.json, not in it). `between: [refA,
    refB]` measures the gen's FROZEN graph on the B-Rep (`measure.py
    distance`) so the agent never guesses points; `expected` ± `tolerance`
    judges `status`. A tap on any dimension explains it (toast).
  - **✓ Verifica esatto**: a user's dimension, tapped, can be redone on the
    gen's frozen B-Rep — `measure.py` op `exact` finds the same vertex /
    circle edge / edge / planar face again and re-measures; `POST
    …/measures/exact` (off_loop, writes nothing). A draft takes the exact
    value. Mesh-lane pieces have no B-Rep and say so. Static preview: the
    snaps work (computation in the browser), exact does not.
  Tests: `tests/test_measures.py`, `tests/test_notes.py`, `tests/ui/measure.test.cjs`.
- **▣ Forme — basic shapes placed ON the part** (✎ Disegna → ▣, `F`): a cube,
  a cylinder or a sphere, in the pen's colour, sent as the note's `shapes`
  (`kind`, `size` in its own frame — a cylinder is [Ø, Ø, h] along `axis` —
  `center`, `quat`, `anchor`/`normal` of the surface, the piece; `cad_notes`
  adds a `summary` and `near_marks`). A tap on the part sets one down SITTING
  on the surface (local Z = the normal). Selected, it wears ONE set of handles
  at a time, picked in ▣ Blocky's tool row (`#s-modes`; `gizmoMode`,
  remembered in localStorage `noodle:view:gizmoMode`; `refreshCage`
  builds only the active set, one function per set, and `handleAt` finds what
  is there): **✥ Sposta** = three arrows along its own X/Y/Z, on a LEASH (the
  centre stays in the piece's box grown by max(¼ of the piece, the shape's
  size)); **⟳ Ruota** = three rings about the centre (Shift 15°); **▣ Gabbia**
  = ALL IN ONE (quill: «fai valere gli spigoli della gabbia per deform, e un po'
  c'è tutto in uno» — the old Scala ⇄ Deforma chip and `cageMode` are gone, a
  stored `noodle:view:cageMode` is simply never read): the 8 **vertices**
  (amber cubes) and the 12 **edges** (pale-amber diamonds at their middle,
  picked on a fat rod over the middle 60% of the edge, distance measured to the
  SEGMENT on screen) bend the shape — an edge moves its two vertices by ONE
  delta, clamped once for both (`FFD.moveEdge`), so the side stays parallel;
  Shift keeps only the dominant axis of the move (in mm). The six **face**
  handles (±X red, ±Y green, ±Z blue) stretch ONE axis with the opposite face
  fixed (a cylinder keeps round, a sphere scales whole), the violet
  **centre** dot scales the whole about its base. Precedence: whatever pick
  volume is hit, the handle nearest the pointer on screen wins — the centre
  included, at its old size and grab (mark min(1.4·grab, 0.15·side), grab
  1.4·grab). Shrinking it and letting every handle beat it (edaaf40) answered
  the wrong complaint: what took «every press» was the BODY moving the shape.
  **Scale
  after a bend** (quill: «si scala con la deformazione applicata»): `ffd` is
  normalised, so a face / the centre scales `size` and the bend grows with it;
  the face handles sit on the BENT face (`FFD.faceMean`, the mean of its 4
  corners), the fixed side is the opposite bent face's centre, and the centre
  dot sits at the bent body's centre. The deformation is a trilinear FFD
  (`webui/ffd.js`, pure, `tests/ui/ffd.test.cjs`): a
  corner's motion fades over the whole body, the other 7 corners and the
  three faces that do not touch it stay exactly put, so the cage's edges stay
  straight and the millimetre paper bends with the body (it reads the REST
  position, `restPos`); corners keep their octant and the minimum apart. The
  note carries `ffd` (8 offsets in the shape's frame, 1 = its size) AND
  `corners` (the 8 in world mm, for a text-only reader); `cad_notes` says
  «deformed». **◌ Nascondi** = no handles; the right button / double tap
  still slides the body. A pen
  colour clicked with a shape selected RECOLOURS it (one undo step; the pen
  takes it too). Standard sizes next to the label: **1mm** / **10mm** (every
  side, Ø and height) and **½ vol** (same shape, scaled until it is half the
  volume of the piece it sits on — the gen's `previews[id].volume`, a
  body's, or a fanned part's triangles; disabled with the reason when none is
  known); the base stays on the surface. On a deformed shape they rescale
  the cage and KEEP the deformation (`ffd` is normalised, so the bend scales
  with it); ½ vol counts the nominal box, not the bend. A drag that changes
  nothing is not an undo step. MOVING IS
  NOT FREE: a slide re-anchors the body on the surface hit under the
  pointer (`stickAt`) or does nothing — quill: «si clicca e appiccica sui
  pezzi». **The slide is the RIGHT button dragged on a shape** (mouse; off the
  shapes the right button is still the pan, and no context menu opens over a
  shape) **or a double tap and drag** (finger: the second press ≤ 300 ms and
  ≤ 20 px from a tap on a shape, `DTAP_MS`/`DTAP_PX`; it wins over the handles
  a small cage spreads under the finger). The LEFT button / one finger on the
  body does not move it (quill: «se premi su un punto qualsiasi della
  superficie sposta il pezzo»): a tap selects the shape, a drag orbits like
  anywhere else; handles still take the left button. A second finger during a
  slide puts the shape back and re-dispatches the first finger to
  OrbitControls, like ✎'s pinch. The body is GRAPH PAPER in the shape's colour (`mmGridMaterial`, a
  shader injected into the standard material): 1 / 5 / 10 mm rules in the
  shape's own millimetres (local position × size, triplanar per face), the
  1 mm rule fading where it would be denser than a few px. The minimum side
  follows the PIECE it sits on (2% of its size, capped at 1 mm — or the next
  drag would snap a 1mm preset back up), so
  corners never meet; the handle MARKS shrink with the shape (≤ 10% of its
  shortest side) while the GRAB volumes stay ~6/9 px, nearest one wins, and
  on the body of the selected shape a handle wins only within half a grab
  radius (else a small shape could never be moved). Phone: the tool row
  wraps and each tool's menu shows only while it is in hand — 604px of tools
  in a 390px screen had been scrolling the whole viewer sideways; `#s-bar`
  moves to the top, takes the full width (`width:max-content` — at left:50%
  it shrank to the modes row and wrapped Togli/✓ off the size row) and
  «· deformato» becomes an amber ≈. A click in the bar's first 400ms is the
  placing tap's ghost and is ignored (`sBarGhost`).
  Screens: `docs/asset/view-shapes-*.png`.
- **⊞ Piano — the pencil draws in the void too** (`webui/view-plane.js`,
  PLAN_VIEW_TOOLS §4; quill: «disegni sui piani anche se non c'è un pezzo, tipo
  ZBrush»). In ✎ Matita, ⊞ + a menu: Superficie (default, as before) / XY / XZ /
  YZ / Vista (perpendicular to the camera, FIXED when picked). For ✎ ✎³ and T
  vernice only: `inkHit()` = `surfaceHit()` first, then `VP.planeHit()` — over
  the part you still draw ON it, in the void on the plane, and with a plane in
  use a drag in the void DRAWS instead of orbiting (right button, wheel, two
  fingers, ✋ Muovi still move the view; the hint says so). The plane goes
  through the point a stroke began on the part (Alt+click on the part puts it
  there without drawing), else the centre of the visible pieces;
  **Shift+wheel** moves it along the normal in round 1-2-5 mm steps (~8 px of
  screen, `mmPerPx`), a phone gets a vertical slider at the side. It is a veil
  ruled 1 / 10 mm (the ▣ Forme paper, own ShaderMaterial) over a rectangle
  round the pieces AND what was drawn on it; its position is in the bar beside
  ⊞ and on the slider — NOT in 3D: a label there sat on the very stroke and
  went into the view photo with it. Mixed strokes: leaving the part's edge
  starts a new stroke (same gesture) that begins at the last point ON the part
  — and the plane is re-anchored right there first, or a Vista plane through
  the start of the stroke put the void part 7 mm behind the silhouette
  (measured on `creepyfinger-v4/g64`; near_piece read 3.08 mm instead of 0); a
  jump > max(pen rule, 4 mm) still breaks it. Data: a sample on the plane has
  normal = the plane's, the stroke no `piece` and `plane: {origin, normal}`
  (a painted label keeps its plane, `L.plane`, for re-lettering). Server
  (`api.add_note` / `_marks`): such a gesture is a mark of `kind: "plane"` with
  its `plane` and `near_piece` {node, title, distance_mm} — point-to-TRIANGLE
  distance (`_point_tri_dist`, numpy) on the gen's FROZEN view.json meshes,
  computed once at save and stored on the stroke. The ⌫ eraser finds void ink
  on SCREEN (`planeInkNear`, segment by segment). `near_piece` skips the
  pieces the note's `hide=` had hidden (a node, a scene body, or one piece of
  a fan-out buffer by its `parts` counts). The sheet is a faint veil fading to
  a rounded-square border (it used to cover most of g64's view), and the line
  where the plane meets the shown pieces is drawn on it — ✂'s CPU slice
  (`sliceTriangles`), solid + faint through the part, computed 150 ms after
  the plane moves and never while a pointer button is down, cached per plane
  (+ section state), the removed side of a ✂ cut dropped. Tests:
  `tests/test_view_plane.py`.
- **The viewer draws on demand** (`CadViewer.invalidate()`, no continuous loop):
  anything that changes the scene from outside the viewer must ask for a frame.
  `/view` does it in `poseTrack()` (every timeline pose) and `apply()` (hidden
  pieces); without it the ▶ player moves the meshes and the canvas stays still.
  `_tick` clears the dirty flag BEFORE it draws, so a hook that runs inside the
  frame (`scene.onBeforeRender`) and asks for another one gets it.
- **✂ Sezione — one plane, the cut face hatched** (`PLAN_VIEW_SECTION.md` §1
  phase 1). ONE state, two ways in: ✂ beside Tutti/Inverti/Inquadra (key X,
  floating X/Y/Z · slider · ⇄ · ✕ bar) and the `section` tool in ✎ Disegna's
  🔧 Tool tab (key X there too) — `webui/view-section.js` builds the controls
  twice from one function. ✂ in a list row leaves that piece WHOLE (the bolt
  intact in the cut nut). Hash `cut=z:12.5&cutflip=1&nocut=n3,n7.2` (nocut
  encoded like `hide=`); a new plane takes the half facing the camera off;
  the slider spans the box of the SHOWN pieces. Rendering in
  `webui/section.js` (for the editor later), pure geometry in
  `section-core.js` (`tests/ui/section.test.cjs`):
  - the cut is `material.clippingPlanes` set in each piece's `onBeforeRender`,
    on whatever material it wears at draw time — never `renderer.
    clippingPlanes` (it would cut grid, notes, tags) — so a restyle (🔍 Aspetto)
    keeps the cut with no call to remember;
  - the cap is the stencil trick PER PIECE (back faces +1, front −1, a quad on
    the plane where ≠ 0, `clearStencil` after each): one stencil for all could
    not tell nested pieces apart. It needs `stencil: true` on the renderer
    (three ≥ r163 no longer asks for one). Caps are opaque, so the
    transmission target (which has a stencil too) draws them behind glass;
  - only CLOSED pieces get a cap (`closedRange`: every welded edge used an even
    number of times); lines, dots and open shells are cut and not capped;
  - hatch in the plane's own axes in mm (pitch ≈ 9 px snapped to 1/2/5, so it
    neither swims nor crawls), 45°/135° chosen greedily between pieces whose
    boxes overlap; the dark contour is the CPU triangle/plane slice, hidden
    while ▶ plays and redrawn when the pieces stop (`setMoving` / `posed`);
  - `firstHit` (the ONE raycast: pen, metro, forme, targhette, selection)
    skips hits on the removed side and returns the CAP when the ray is inside
    a cut piece at the plane (odd number of that piece's surfaces crossed —
    the stencil's parity); `h.cap` → the metro takes a free point there;
  - a note drawn on a sectioned view saves `cut: {axis, pos, flip, nocut?}`
    and the server adds `keeps: "y >= 0"`; `cad_notes` shows it
    (`tests/test_view_section.py`).
- **🔍 Aspetto — glass, glow or ghost, for THIS view only** (`webui/view-look.js`,
  PLAN_VIEW_SECTION §2): 🎨 on every row of the piece list (a node row = all its
  leaves), on the selection bar, or `G`; the gen stays immutable, the look lives
  in the hash — `#look=n3:glass,n7.2:emissive:#ffcc00,n5:ghost,n9:#ff0000`
  (finish and/or colour, a bare node id = all its leaves), read once at boot,
  written on every change. Per LEAF, like visibility: a whole object swaps its
  material; one piece of a fan-out gets a PROXY mesh (shared buffers, a group
  of its own) and its group material hidden — swapping the group in place
  would make one emissive piece light the whole buffer, because the glow pass
  renders whole objects. `markGlow` + `viewer.syncGlow()` after each change.
  - **👻 fantasma** is a finish of `makeMaterial` (editor too, 🎨 modal):
    alpha 0.15, `depthWrite:false`, plus opaque sharp edges (`ghostEdges`,
    EdgesGeometry 30°, never pickable). Ghost in ghost shows (glass in glass
    does not — §0 of the plan), and it is the same on a phone. A pick goes
    THROUGH a ghost (`firstHit` → `hitOf(hits, skipGhost)`): click the servo
    inside the ghost shell and you get the servo, and the pen draws on it.
  - **«Guarda dentro»** (in the menu): the piece stays, everything that COVERS
    it goes all-glass or all-ghost, never a mix; again = back. «Covers» is
    rays, not boxes (`coverOf`: 60 surface points × 26 directions, first other
    piece hit, ≥10% of rays): measured on `creepyfinger-v4/g64`, the
    electronics sit in a shell cut in two halves and neither half's bbox holds
    60% of theirs (0.40 / 0.55) — the plan's «bbox che lo contiene» found
    nothing. Rays give the two shells + the phalanx in front of the servo.
  - Not verified: a real Android phone (glass there loses the inner glass
    entirely, `WEBGL_multisampled_render_to_texture`, plan §0.2). A big
    emissive body floods the frame with bloom (existing glow pass, not new).
- **Plates step aside when you zoom into them** (`webui/view-plates.js`,
  PLAN_VIEW_TOOLS §3). ONE builder for the three plates of /view —
  `makePlate()` (dot + stem + plate: the user's ⚑ targhetta via `tagObject`,
  the agent's tags) and `plateSprites()` (the bare plate: the ↔ metro's value,
  whose side of the line is its `place(cam)` callback). They stay what they
  were — mm-sized sprites, solid + 0.35 ghost — until the plate on screen is
  too big to read as a word: ≥ 92% of the viewport wide, letters ≥ 56 px
  (`letter` = letter height / plate height, from the canvas builder), or a big
  plate cut by the screen edge. Hysteresis 1.0 / 0.8. Then it SLIDES away
  from the zoom point (last wheel cursor, pinch centre, else the middle; a
  mouse orbit/pan resets it), preferring its stem's direction on screen, and
  never onto its own anchor (`keep`) — or, with no room, FADES to 0.15 (down
  to 0.06 the more oversized it is), stem included, dot never. ~150 ms. The
  plan's "60% of the viewport" was tuned up by eye on creepyfinger-v4 g51/g64:
  an 84%-wide agent tag still reads at a glance. Hover holds a stepped-aside
  plate at full opacity only when the pointer ENTERS it (zooming at the cursor
  puts the cursor on it already, and a wheel lets go); on touch, a TAP decided
  on lift (the first finger of a pinch lands on it too). It all runs in
  `scene.onBeforeRender` (main frame only, not the bloom target), so only
  when a frame is drawn. **Trap, paid for:** an `invalidate()` from inside a
  frame used to be eaten (`_tick` cleared `_dirty` AFTER rendering) and a
  plate froze half faded; `_tick` now clears it before drawing, so the
  transition asks for its next frame with a plain `invalidate()`. No
  registry: plates are found by `traverseVisible` each frame.
  Tests: `tests/ui/plates.test.cjs`.
- **✂ × 🔍 × ⊞ — where the four tools meet** (`tests/test_view_int.py`).
  ONE `firstHit` → `hitOf(hits, skipGhost)`: the first pass looks through
  ghosts, the second takes them; inside each pass a hit on the side the cut
  removed is air and the cap parity is counted on the hits that pass may take
  — so a ghost's cap is looked through with the ghost. section.js re-hooks
  the cut EVERY frame (a flag per object), because Aspetto adds children after
  bind: a fan-out piece's proxy (`userData.lookProxy`, its own group 0) and a
  ghost's edges were drawn whole on a cut view; the cap reads colour and
  visibility from the proxy, and a ghost's cap is hatched at 0.3 alpha with
  no depth (CustomBlending, so it stays in the opaque list and in stencil
  order). One stencil count per LEAF, not per drawn object: no double cap.
  In the piece list ✂ and 🎨 are 24 px (36 on touch) before ◎.

- **✎ spray, ✎³ filament — two pens that LOOK different** (`webui/ink.js`, pure,
  `tests/ui/ink.test.cjs`; materials in `webui/view-ink.js`). quill: «i tubi
  della penna 3D più ombreggiati … e quella normale più simile a vernice spray
  che si omogeneizza». Only the drawing changed: the note's data are the same.
  ✎ is a flat band on the surface, one quad per segment, each quad a soft
  CAPSULE in its own coordinates (round ends, a fading mist to 1.3 r with a
  speckle fixed in model space; T vernice letters crisper, and the fade never
  eats a thin line's last pixel — `fwidth`). **The trick for the even coat:**
  blending sums coverage, so crossings and every joint went darker; a coat of
  paint is the MAX. The canvas has no destination alpha, the depth buffer does
  the max: each fragment writes `gl_FragDepth` pulled toward the camera by its
  coverage (a × r, view-space mm, never under the depth step at that
  distance), pass 1 writes depth only, pass 2 blends with LessEqual — one blend
  per pixel. A new colour starts a RUN (`nextRun`) one `runStep` nearer, drawn
  after the previous one (renderOrder 100+2·run): the last colour covers, its
  mist blends over the earlier ink, not over the part. Runs cap at 4 so a long
  note never floats its last colour off the part. Both passes stay in the
  OPAQUE list (CustomBlending blends with `transparent:false`): ink on a piece
  inside 🔎 glass is still in the transmission target, a 👻 ghost blends over
  it. ✎³ is a real tube framed by the SURFACE normal (no twist), Catmull-Rom
  smoothed (×3), 16 sides, hemispherical ends, MeshPhysical with a clearcoat,
  NOT tone mapped (ACES turned green into pastel) and a baked occlusion round
  the section (dark underside = contact with the part / the layer below),
  alternate layers ±8%. A saved stroke does not say which pen drew it: it is
  filament if it piled up (`lifts`), spray otherwise — a ✎³ line that never
  stacked comes back as spray after a reload. `disposeObj` skips the shared
  spray materials (`isShared`).

## 9d. Exports — the bake bundle and the per-workflow index

**The 📦 bake** (`⬇ Export` in the editor, default choice; `⬇ STEP+STL` on each home
card; `POST /api/graph/{name}/export/bundle`; `api.export_all`; MCP `cad_export_all`)
exports what the viewport SHOWS, not `__result__`: every entry of `__previews__` (the
one dict `Transpiler._previewed` fills) becomes `NN_<title>_<id>.step` + `.stl`, zipped
with a `manifest.json`. Runtime in `cad_nodes/bake.py` (runs in the worker). It bakes the
SAVED params — a Drop/Animate comes out posed at its slider's `t`, and a Drop's moving
container (`_noodle_extra`) gets its own `_container` pair. What a format cannot hold
is recorded in the manifest (`skipped`), never raised: a mesh-lane node has no B-Rep, so
STL only (MeshToSolid is the explicit, slow bridge — §5c); a curve gets STEP only;
points get nothing. The bake must never re-parent what it exports: on the warm
worker the previewed shapes are the memo cache's own objects, shared with
`__result__`, and `Compound(children=...)` moves them under the new compound —
after one bake the next ⬇ STEP of the result failed. `bake._as_brep` uses
`Compound(list)`, and wraps a single shape that has a parent (build123d cannot
STEP-export it directly); `tests/test_bake.py`. The home card exports the graph ON DISK (no body); the editor saves
first and posts its snapshot.

**The index** — `projects/<name>/exports/index.jsonl`, `cad_nodes/export_index.py`.
Every file in exports/ says who wrote it: an Export node (`_out(path, node_id)` in the
PREAMBLE appends the line from inside the worker — the generated script cannot import
cad_nodes), the ⬇ button (`exports/<name>.<ext>`), or a bundle
(`exports/<name>_<date>.zip`, with the node list inside). JSONL and O_APPEND because
TWO processes write it; `load()` folds it (last line per file wins, deleted files drop
out) and, given the current graph, adds the node's current title, whether it still
exists, and `fresh` = `graph_key` unchanged. `graph_key` hashes types + params (minus
`_ui`) + bypass + wiring only, so moving or restyling a node does not mark exports
stale; the executor hands it to the worker as `__GRAPH_KEY__`. A file older than the
index still finds its Export node by file name (`guessed`). The library (`/library`)
shows it all, with search, `?p=<project>` focus, and a link per node to
`/nodes?p=<project>&node=<id>`, which selects and flashes that node.

Sorting: home and the editor's project menu share `localStorage noodle:sort:workflows`
(`date` = graph.json mtime, the `/api/projects` `mtime` field; or `name`); the library
keeps its own `noodle:sort:library`. Tests: `tests/test_export_index.py`.

## 9e. ▦ Sezioni — a CodeBlock read as the nodes it already contains

Agents write long CodeBlocks (the TARS-pet body: ~570 lines, 18 sections). Asking
them to build the same thing out of catalogue nodes would make their work heavier;
instead noodle READS the block. `cad_nodes/sections.py` (pure `ast`, no build123d):

- **Sections** come from the block's own header comments (`# ---- servo ----`,
  `# ======== frontale ========`, ≥ 2 of them), else statements are grouped by the
  variable they build, with `#@param` lines → *Parametri*, pure arithmetic of
  params → *Quote*, `def`s → *Funzioni*; a single-assignment wrapper of one group
  (`dummy = Compound(ghost)`, `result = body`) joins that group.
- **Kinds**: params | quote | funcs | part | **chain** — a section that keeps working
  on a shape an earlier section made (`bezel -= …`), i.e. one step of a part, as a
  feature tree would show it. Detected through `x += …` anywhere in the statement
  and in-place mutators (`ghost.append`).
- **Edges**: straight-line reaching definitions per statement; names a compound
  statement binds before use (loop / comprehension targets, inner assignments) are
  local, so `for sx in …` never "reads" another section's `sx`; calling a helper adds
  its free variables at the call site (Python binds them when it runs). Also
  `outputs` (#@out / result → section), `result_items` (each item of a
  `result = [...]` list → the section that makes it) and `unused` sections.
- **The run** (`executor.codeblock_sections_run`, `POST …/sections/run`): the block
  and ONLY its ancestors, all previews off, the block's code replaced by
  `sections.instrument()` — a COPY with `__sec_mark__('sN', locals())` after every
  contiguous range of every section (+ a nonce comment so its memo key is unique,
  upstream stays cached). Per-section time = sum of its ranges; numbers each
  section leaves; for `?section=sN` its shapes (what it hands on first, scratch lists
  only if nothing else) as `view.previews`; `failed_in` = first section whose marker
  never ran. `execute_code(publish=False)`: no view.json, no root progress pointer.
- **UI**: ▦ Sezioni under ✎ Edit code opens a read-only full-screen view: columns
  by dependency (Parametri/Quote/Funzioni left; their edges drawn only for the
  selection), colour by kind, dashed = unused, ⏱ Misura, per-section code, uses /
  used by / values, ▶ Anteprima in its own CadViewer, ✎ Nel codice selects the lines.
  It saves the canvas first (the analysis reads the saved block).
- Next steps (not built): edit a section's lines from its node; per-section memo
  so a change re-runs from that section on; explode into real wired CodeBlocks.
- Tests: `tests/test_sections.py` (analysis), `tests/test_sections_run.py` (image).
