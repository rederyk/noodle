GraphStore — filesystem persistence for node graphs.

Layout (one directory per graph, shared with the REST server's projects dir):
    <root>/<graph_id>/graph.json   # the graph
    <root>/<graph_id>/meta.json    # {"backend": "nodegraph", ...}
    <root>/<graph_id>/output.stl   # last execution
    <root>/<graph_id>/view.json    # last execution view

The default root is taken from $CAD_PROJECTS_DIR, falling back to /app/projects
(the Docker volume) so REST and MCP operate on the same graphs.
